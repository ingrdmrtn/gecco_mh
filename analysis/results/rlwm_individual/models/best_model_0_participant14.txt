def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    Uncertainty-gated RL+WM mixture.

    Idea
    - Choices arise from a mixture of RL and WM policies.
    - The WM weight is computed dynamically each trial based on relative uncertainty:
      higher WM weight when RL is uncertain (high entropy) and WM is confident (low entropy).
    - WM weight also shifts with set size (3 vs 6) via a size-bias term.
    - WM has its own learning and decay dynamics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    states : array-like of int
        State index on each trial (0..nS-1 within a block).
    actions : array-like of int
        Chosen action on each trial (0..2).
    rewards : array-like of {0,1}
        Binary feedback for each trial.
    blocks : array-like of int
        Block index per trial.
    set_sizes : array-like of int
        Number of unique states in the current block for each trial (3 or 6 here).
    model_parameters : iterable of length 6
        - lr: RL learning rate (0..1).
        - softmax_beta: Base RL inverse temperature (scaled internally by 10).
        - gate_bias: Intercept for WM gating; larger favors WM.
        - gate_size: Set-size bias for WM gating; positive values favor WM more in small sets.
        - wm_decay: Per-trial WM decay toward uniform (0..1).
        - wm_learn: WM imprint/learning strength on the current state (0..1).

    Set-size impact
    - WM weight per trial includes an additive bias gate_size * (3.5 - nS), increasing WM reliance at nS=3
      if gate_size > 0 and decreasing it at nS=6.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Negative log-likelihood of the observed choices.
