def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL + WM with set-size-specific arbitration weights and WM decay + global lapse.

    Mechanism
    - RL: tabular Q-learning with softmax policy (inverse temperature scaled by 10).
    - WM: probability table over actions per state; when rewarded, WM stores a peaked distribution; when not rewarded,
      WM decays toward uniform at rate wm_decay.
    - Arbitration: mixture of WM and RL with different mixture weights for small (3) vs large (6) set sizes.
    - Lapse: with small probability epsilon, choice is random uniform over actions.

    Set-size dependence
    - The arbitration weight depends directly on the block set size: wm_weight_small for set size 3, wm_weight_large for set size 6.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_parameters : tuple
        lr : float
            RL learning rate (0..1).
        wm_weight_small : float
            WM mixture weight for set size 3 blocks (0..1).
        wm_weight_large : float
            WM mixture weight for set size 6 blocks (0..1).
        softmax_beta : float
            RL inverse temperature; internally scaled by 10.
        wm_decay : float
            WM decay toward uniform on non-rewarded trials (0..1).
        epsilon : float
            Lapse probability mixing uniform choice into the final policy (0..0.2 typical).

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Negative log-likelihood of observed actions.
