def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL with Pearce-Hall associability and recency-based WM that is load-sensitive.

    Idea:
    - RL: learning rate is modulated per-state by associability (Pearce-Hall). Associability increases with
      recent absolute prediction error in that state and decays otherwise.
    - WM: retains a leaky trace of the last rewarded action per state. WM decay accelerates with larger set sizes,
      capturing load-induced interference.
    - Policy: mixture of RL and WM softmax policies.

    Parameters:
    - lr_base: float in [0,1]. Base RL learning rate, scaled by per-state associability.
    - beta_rl: float >= 0. RL inverse temperature; internally scaled by 10.
    - wm_weight: float in [0,1]. Mixture weight on WM vs RL policy.
    - wm_decay_base: float in [0,1]. Baseline per-trial decay of WM traces toward uniform when not refreshed.
    - xi_load_sensitivity: float >= 0. Load sensitivity scaling; larger values increase WM decay as set size grows.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
