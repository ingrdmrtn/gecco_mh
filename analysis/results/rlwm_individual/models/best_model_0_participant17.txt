    """
    RL + WM implementing a WSLS-like heuristic, with set-size-dependent lapse

    Mechanism:
    - RL: standard delta rule with learning rate lr.
    - WM: encodes a win-stay/lose-shift tendency within each state by shaping a preference vector:
        * After reward, set w[s] ≈ one-hot for the chosen action (stay).
        * After no reward, down-weight the chosen action and up-weight others (shift).
      WM policy uses near-deterministic softmax over w[s].
    - Mixture: convex combination of WM and RL.
    - Lapse: an additional stimulus-independent lapse probability that increases with set size,
      mixing the final policy with uniform: epsilon = min(0.5, epsilon_size_slope * (set_size - 3)).

    Parameters
    - lr: [0,1], RL learning rate.
    - wm_weight: [0,1], mixture weight on WM policy.
    - softmax_beta: >=0, base inverse temperature for RL (internally scaled by 10).
    - wsls_strength: [0,1], how strongly WM pushes toward stay on wins and away on losses.
    - epsilon_size_slope: >=0, slope controlling how lapse increases with set size.

    Returns
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
