    """
    RL+WM mixture with probabilistic recall policy and load-dependent recall plus WM decay.

    Overview:
    - RL: tabular Q-learning with a single learning rate and softmax policy (beta scaled by 10).
    - WM policy: mixture of a recall-driven delta (choosing the WM argmax) and a uniform guess.
        Recall probability depends on:
          * A base recall rate modulated by set size (worse recall at larger set size).
          * The confidence in WM (difference between top two WM action weights), scaled by rec_sensitivity.
      When recall occurs, action probabilities are a near-delta on the WM argmax via deterministic softmax.
    - WM update: decay toward uniform and reward-gated consolidation toward chosen action.

    Set-size impact:
    - Recall base decreases with set size.
    - WM decay increases with set size.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: float in [0,1], RL learning rate.
    - wm_weight: float in [0,1], mixture weight of WM in the action policy.
    - softmax_beta: float >= 0, RL inverse temperature; internally scaled by 10.
    - rec_base: float in [0,1], base recall probability at set size 3.
    - rec_sensitivity: float >= 0, scales the effect of WM confidence (top-vs-next difference) on recall probability.
    - wm_decay_base: float in [0,1], base WM decay toward uniform per trial (amplified by set size).

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
