    """
    RL + WM with RPE-gated arbitration and set-size cost.
    - Policy: convex mixture of RL softmax and WM softmax.
    - Arbitration: WM weight increases when unsigned RPE is small (RL confident),
      and decreases with larger set sizes (capacity cost).
    - WM dynamics: leaky cache toward uniform; reward strengthens chosen action.

    Parameters (tuple):
    - lr: learning rate for RL value updates and WM storage after reward (0..1).
    - wm_base: baseline WM contribution before gating (0..1 in practice).
    - softmax_beta: inverse temperature for RL softmax; internally scaled x10.
    - wm_decay: per-visit leak of WM toward uniform (0..1).
    - arbi_rpe_gain: strength of RPE-based arbitration (>=0). Weight term uses (1 - |RPE|).
    - ss_cost_gain: penalty on WM weight with larger set sizes (>=0). Weight reduced by ss_cost_gain*(nS-3).

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
