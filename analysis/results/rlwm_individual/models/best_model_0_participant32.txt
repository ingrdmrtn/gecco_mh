def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL + WM with rehearsal and state-wise choice stickiness; WM suffers set-size–dependent decay.
    - RL: standard delta rule with softmax policy (beta scaled by 10).
    - WM: associative weights per state updated by rehearsal and decay; rewarded actions are reinforced.
    - Stickiness: WM policy is biased toward the last action taken in that state (perseveration).
    - Set size effect: WM decay is stronger in larger set sizes.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: RL learning rate (0-1).
    - wm_weight: Mixture weight of WM in the action policy (0-1).
    - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature; internally scaled by 10.
    - wm_rehearsal: Strength by which the chosen action is rehearsed in WM on each visit (>=0).
    - wm_decay: Base decay of WM toward uniform on each trial (0-1); scaled up by set size.
    - stickiness: Bias added to the WM logits for the previously chosen action in the same state (>=0).

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
