def cognitive_model3(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL with load-dependent value decay + WM with Hebbian recency and global action interference.

    Mechanism
    - RL: Q-learning plus passive decay of Q-values toward uniform each trial; decay increases with set size.
    - WM: recency-weighted Hebbian update toward the chosen action when rewarded; additionally, each choice
          induces global action interference that slightly biases all states' WM toward the chosen action,
          mimicking confusion/interference among items at higher load.
    - Mixture: WM and RL policies are combined by wm_weight.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_parameters : tuple
        - lr: RL learning rate (0..1).
        - wm_weight: mixture weight of WM vs RL (0..1).
        - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature; internally scaled by 10.
        - q_decay_base: base RL decay toward uniform (0..1); effective decay scales with set size.
        - wm_interf: strength (0..1) of global action interference per choice (applied to all states).
        - wm_alpha: WM learning rate toward one-hot on rewarded trials (0..1).

    Set-size effects
    ----------------
    - RL decay: q_decay_eff = q_decay_base * (nS / 6). Larger set size yields stronger decay of Q-values.
      This captures reduced RL stability under higher cognitive load.
