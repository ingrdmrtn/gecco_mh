def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with WM decay and set-size-dependent WM engagement.

    Idea:
    - Decisions are a mixture of a model-free RL policy and a working-memory (WM) policy.
    - WM stores the last rewarded action for a given state and decays toward uniform.
    - The WM contribution is reduced under higher set size (load).
    
    Parameters (tuple): (lr, wm_weight, softmax_beta, wm_decay, wm_neg)
    - lr: RL learning rate for Q-values (0..1).
    - wm_weight: Base weight of WM in the mixture (0..1); scaled down by set size.
    - softmax_beta: Inverse temperature for RL policy (positive), internally scaled by 10.
    - wm_decay: Decay of WM toward uniform per trial for the visited state (0..1).
    - wm_neg: How much negative feedback resets WM toward uniform for that state (0..1).
    
    Set-size effects:
    - Effective WM weight is scaled as wm_weight_eff = wm_weight * (3.0 / nS), reducing WM contribution for nS=6.
