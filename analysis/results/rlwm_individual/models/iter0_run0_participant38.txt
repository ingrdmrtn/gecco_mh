    RL+WM capacity model with age- and set-size-dependent WM weighting and perseveration.
    
    Model summary:
    - Choice is a mixture of a slow RL system and a fast, capacity-limited WM system.
    - WM weight is reduced at larger set sizes and further reduced for older adults.
    - WM is a fast cache that stores the last rewarded action for each state, with decay.
    - RL learns via a single learning rate.
    - Perseveration (stickiness) biases choices toward the previous action in a block.
    
    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: scalar in [0,1], learning rate for RL.
    - wm_weight_base: base mixture weight of WM channel (0..1), before adjustments.
    - softmax_beta: inverse temperature for RL softmax, scaled by 10 inside (higher = more deterministic).
    - wm_decay: decay rate of WM toward uniform (0..1).
    - capacity_sensitivity: slope controlling how WM weight drops as set size increases.
    - stickiness: perseveration bias added to action values for last chosen action in the block.
    
    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices under the model.
