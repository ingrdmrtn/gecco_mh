Here are three alternative RL+WM cognitive models tailored to your rlwm task. Each model is a standalone function that returns the negative log-likelihood of the observed actions, and each uses up to 6 parameters. All functions follow (and fill in) the provided template structure, implementing a working-memory policy and updates alongside a standard RL learner. I also specify how set size (3 vs 6) impacts parameters within each model.

def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with load-scaled WM weight and decay.
    - The RL system learns with a Rescorla-Wagner update.
    - The WM system stores the last rewarded action for each state (one-shot encoding), with decay toward uniform.
    - WM contribution to choice is scaled down by set size via an exponential load factor.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: RL learning rate (0..1)
    - wm_weight: Base mixture weight for WM (0..1), modulated by set size
    - softmax_beta: Inverse temperature for RL policy (scaled by 10 internally)
    - wm_decay: Working-memory decay toward uniform per trial (0..1)
    - load_sensitivity: Scales how strongly set size reduces effective WM weight; higher values reduce WM more at set size 6

    Set size effect:
    - Effective WM weight = wm_weight * exp(-load_sensitivity * (nS - 3)), so it is smaller for 6 than for 3.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed actions.

Notes on the participant data and set-size effects:
- In blocks with set size 3, WM should contribute more strongly; these models implement that via either scaling wm_weight (models 1 and 2) or increasing misbinding at larger set sizes (model 3).
- The poor performance in the set size 6 block is consistent with reduced WM influence or increased interference, which models 1–3 implement via load_sensitivity (models 1 and 2) or swap_k/swap_bias (model 3).
- You can fit these models to the provided data by optimizing their parameters to minimize the returned negative log-likelihood.
