    RL + WM with surprise-gated WM encoding and load-modulated forgetting.

    Idea:
    - RL learns action values via delta rule and softmax.
    - WM stores a one-shot policy per state when outcomes are surprising and rewarding.
    - Surprise is approximated from the current state's RL certainty: surprise ≈ 1 - max(Q_s).
    - WM decay increases with load (larger set size => faster forgetting).
    - Arbitration between WM and RL is gated by surprise: more surprise => rely more on WM.

    Parameters:
    - lr: RL learning rate in [0,1].
    - wm_weight_base: Base weight for WM contribution in [0,1].
    - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (scaled internally x10).
    - wm_forget: Baseline WM forgetting rate in [0,1]. Larger => faster decay toward uniform.
    - pe_sensitivity: Surprise sensitivity (>=0). Scales the sigmoid that maps surprise to WM arbitration and storage strength.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.

    RL + probabilistic WM slots with decision-level marginalization.

    Idea:
    - RL learns via delta rule and softmax.
    - WM capacity is limited to a fixed number of 'slots' shared across states in a block.
    - For any state, the probability it is in WM is p_in = min(1, slots / set_size).
    - Decision policy marginalizes over whether the current state is in WM:
        p_wm_eff = p_in * softmax(W_s) + (1 - p_in) * uniform.
    - WM updates: reward strengthens one-hot memory, no-reward decays to uniform.
    - WM reliability (both update strength and policy determinism) is controlled by noise_wm.

    Parameters:
    - lr: RL learning rate in [0,1].
    - wm_weight: Mixture weight for WM contribution in [0,1].
