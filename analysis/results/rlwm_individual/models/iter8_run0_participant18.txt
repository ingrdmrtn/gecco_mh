Below are three standalone cognitive models that follow the provided template structure. Each returns the negative log-likelihood of the observed choices. They differ in how the WM policy is constructed, how WM is updated, and how WM vs RL arbitration depends on surprise/recency/thresholds and set size.

Note: Assume numpy is already imported as np.

    """
    Model 1: Surprise-penalized WM arbitration with global WM decay
    - RL: Rescorla-Wagner with learning rate lr and softmax inverse temperature softmax_beta.
    - WM policy: Deterministic softmax over WM table W_s with high inverse temperature.
    - Arbitration: Mixture of WM and RL where effective WM weight is downregulated by surprise
      (prediction error magnitude from RL) and by set-size cost.
        wm_weight_eff = sigmoid(logit(wm_weight) - pe_sensitivity*|r - Q(s,a)| - size_cost*(nS-3))
    - WM updating: Global decay toward uniform each trial (wm_decay). Rewarded trials consolidate
      the correct association toward a one-hot vector with strength proportional to wm_weight
      (the same parameter used as baseline mixture weight, linking reliance and consolidation).
    - Set-size effect: Larger set size reduces WM contribution via size_cost.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: RL learning rate (0..1).
    - wm_weight: Baseline arbitration weight and WM consolidation strength (0..1).
    - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature; internally scaled by 10.
    - wm_decay: Global decay of WM toward uniform per trial (0..1).
    - pe_sensitivity: How strongly surprise (|r - Q|) suppresses WM reliance (>0).
    - size_cost: Linear penalty of WM reliance with set size (>0).

    - WM updating: Rewarded trials strengthen WM mapping toward chosen action proportional to wm_weight.

    Model 3: Thresholded WM access with set-size–dependent criterion and sharp arbitration
    - RL: Rescorla-Wagner with learning rate lr and softmax inverse temperature softmax_beta.

    - Arbitration: Gate uses WM if the WM "confidence" (max(W_s) - mean(W_s)) exceeds a threshold.
      The threshold rises with set size:

Modeling notes on set-size effects:
- Model 1 reduces WM reliance linearly with set size via size_cost, and also via surprise (large PE -> less WM).
- Model 2 reduces WM reliance with set size via size_sensitivity and increases reliance when the state is revisited soon (recency_sensitivity).
- Model 3 raises the WM confidence threshold with set size via theta_size_slope, making WM less likely to dominate in larger sets.
