    Simulate choices and rewards using the RL+WM model with rehearsal, set-size–dependent decay, and state-wise stickiness.

    Inputs:
    - stimulus: array of state indices per trial (assumed 0..nS-1 within block)
    - blocks: array of block index per trial
    - set_sizes: array of set size per trial (constant within each block)
