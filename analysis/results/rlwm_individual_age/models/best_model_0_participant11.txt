def cognitive_model2(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL + surprise-gated WM (mixture). WM encoding is driven by RL prediction error magnitude
    and is less likely under higher set size and for older age.

    Mechanism:
    - RL: tabular Q-learning with softmax choice.
    - WM: per-state policy w[s,:], updated when a gate opens. The gate is a sigmoid of the
      unsigned prediction error |delta|, minus penalties for set size and age.
    - Arbitration: WM vs RL mixture where the WM weight on each trial equals the current gate value.
      Thus, when surprise is high, WM dominates; otherwise, RL dominates.
    - WM decays slightly each trial toward uniform; stronger gates write more strongly.

    Parameters (list of length 6):
    - lr: RL learning rate (0..1).
    - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (scaled by 10 internally).
    - wm_gate_base: baseline gate bias; higher means more frequent WM gating.
    - wm_pe_gain: sensitivity of the gate to |prediction error|.
    - ss_gate_penalty: penalty per increase in set size beyond 3 that closes the gate (>=0).
    - age_gate_penalty: penalty applied for older adults that closes the gate (>=0).

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
