    """
    RL + WSLS-like WM and learned age/size gate.

    Description:
    - Choices are a mixture of RL and a simple state-wise WSLS working-memory heuristic.
    - RL uses a single learning rate, but negative prediction errors are amplified by a factor (neg_mult).
      This is not the same as separate learning rates; it scales deltas only when negative.
    - WM stores the last action and outcome per state. Its policy favors repeating last rewarded action,
      and avoiding last unrewarded action (WSLS), implemented via a sharp softmax on a transformed WM vector.
    - Arbitration: WM mixture weight is a learned gate that is multiplicatively modulated by an age-by-size factor.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - alpha_rl: RL learning rate (0..1)
    - beta_rl: RL inverse temperature (scaled internally by 10)
    - wm_weight0: baseline WM mixture weight (0..1)
    - wm_wsls_bias: strength of WSLS transform (>=0; larger makes WM more deterministic)
    - neg_mult: multiplier on negative prediction errors (>0, e.g., 1..3)

    Age and set size usage:
    - Effective WM weight = wm_weight0 * gate(age, size), where
      gate(age,size) = (young: 1.1, old: 0.9) * (3/nS). Thus, WM has more impact in small sets and for younger adults.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
