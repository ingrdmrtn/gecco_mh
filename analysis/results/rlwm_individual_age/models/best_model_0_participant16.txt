def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with set-size- and age-modulated WM precision and choice perseveration.

    Idea:
    - Decisions are a weighted mixture of a model-free RL policy and a working-memory (WM) policy.
    - WM stores last rewarded action for each state, with interference that increases with set size.
    - The WM precision and mixture weight are scaled by set size and age group.
    - RL includes a per-state choice perseveration bias that is stronger for older adults.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: RL learning rate for Q-values in [0,1].
    - softmax_beta: base inverse temperature for RL softmax; internally scaled up (x10).
    - kappa_base: base strength of choice perseveration (sticky choice bonus added to chosen action).
    - wm_prec_base: base WM precision/weight driver; higher increases WM determinism and weight.
    - age_wm_drop: reduction factor for WM precision/weight for older adults (0..1); no effect if young.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
