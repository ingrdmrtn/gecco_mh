def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL + decaying WM with age- and load-modulated WM precision.

    Mechanism:
    - RL: tabular Q-learning with softmax.
    - WM: per-state categorical cache that becomes more precise after reward, but decays toward uniform.
          WM precision is reduced at set size 6 (interference) and boosted for younger adults.
    - Arbitration: fixed mixture weight between WM and RL.

    Parameters (6):
    - model_parameters = [lr, wm_weight, softmax_beta, wm_decay, size6_noise, age_wm_boost]
      lr: RL learning rate in [0,1]
      wm_weight: mixture weight for WM in [0,1]
      softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (scaled by *10 internally)
      wm_decay: per-visit decay of WM traces toward uniform in [0,1]
      size6_noise: multiplicative reduction of WM precision at set size 6 in [0,1]
      age_wm_boost: multiplicative boost of WM precision for young vs old:
                    wm_beta_mult = 1 + age_wm_boost*(1 - 2*age_group),
                    so young (0) -> boost; old (1) -> reduction.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of the observed choices.
