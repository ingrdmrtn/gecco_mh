def cognitive_model2(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL with eligibility trace + gated WM by prediction-error magnitude.

    Idea:
    - RL: single learning rate, but with an eligibility trace that keeps a short-term
      trace of the last chosen action within each state. This allows small spillover
      to nonchosen actions within the visited state, controlled by lambda.
    - WM: stores one-shot associations only when the unsigned prediction error is high,
      with a gate threshold that depends on age and set size (older adults and larger
      set sizes raise the threshold, reducing WM engagement).
    - Arbitration: the WM gate probability (sigmoid of PE minus threshold) is used as
      the mixture weight between WM and RL policies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    states : array-like of int
        State index per trial.
    actions : array-like of int
        Observed actions (0..2).
    rewards : array-like of float
        Binary rewards (0/1).
    blocks : array-like of int
        Block index per trial.
    set_sizes : array-like of int
        Set size per trial (3 or 6).
    age : array-like of int
        Participant age repeated per trial. Age group: 0 if <=45, 1 if >45.
    model_parameters : list or array
        [lr, softmax_beta, lambda_et, wm_gate_base, age_gate_delta, setsize_gate_delta]
        - lr: RL learning rate.
        - softmax_beta: inverse temperature (scaled x10 internally).
        - lambda_et: eligibility trace decay (0..1).
        - wm_gate_base: base gate threshold for PE to engage WM.
        - age_gate_delta: increase in threshold for older adults.
        - setsize_gate_delta: increase in threshold when set size increases from 3 to 6.

    Returns
    -------
    nll : float
        Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
