def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: RL + WM with entropy-based arbitration and set-size/age-scaled WM precision
    - RL: delta-rule with single learning rate.
    - WM: fast associative memory storing rewarded actions; errors cause decay toward uniform.
    - Arbitration: mix weight increases when RL is uncertain (high entropy). Negative outcomes
      suppress WM influence and induce decay in WM memory.
    - Set size and age: larger set sizes and older age reduce WM precision (beta_wm) and WM influence.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: RL learning rate (0..1).
    - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (scaled internally by 10).
    - wm_bias: baseline bias toward WM in the mixture (logit space).
    - ss_scale: how much larger set sizes reduce WM precision and influence (>=0).
    - age_wm_mult: multiplicative penalty on WM precision/influence for older group (>=0).
    - neg_error_decay: strength of WM decay and WM down-weighting after negative feedback (>=0).

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
