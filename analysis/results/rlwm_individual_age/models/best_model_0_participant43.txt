def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL + eligibility traces mixed with capacity-limited WM; WM precision declines with set size and age.

    Mechanism
    - Policy is a convex combination of RL softmax and WM softmax.
    - RL uses a standard TD update with an eligibility trace over state-action pairs to allow some credit
      assignment spillover across time. The trace decays by lambda each trial.
    - WM encodes the last rewarded mapping in a one-shot manner but decays/leaks toward uniform. Its precision
      (effective inverse temperature) declines with set size and is further reduced in older adults.
    - The WM mixture weight is fixed within a block (base wm_weight) but is scaled down in larger set sizes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    states : array-like of int
        State index at each trial, zero-based within each block.
    actions : array-like of int
        Chosen action at each trial (0..2).
    rewards : array-like of int
        Reward feedback (0/1) at each trial.
    blocks : array-like of int
        Block index for each trial.
    set_sizes : array-like of int
        Set size (3 or 6) for the block of each trial.
    age : array-like
        Participant's age (repeated). Age group: 0=young (<=45), 1=old (>45).
    model_parameters : list or array
        [lr, wm_weight, softmax_beta, trace_lambda, wm_decay, age_wm_noise]
        - lr: RL learning rate (0..1)
        - wm_weight: base mixture weight for WM in the policy (0..1)
        - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature; scaled by 10 internally
        - trace_lambda: eligibility trace decay (0..1)
        - wm_decay: WM decay per trial toward uniform (0..1)
        - age_wm_noise: multiplicative factor increasing WM imprecision in older adults

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Negative log-likelihood of observed choices under the model.
