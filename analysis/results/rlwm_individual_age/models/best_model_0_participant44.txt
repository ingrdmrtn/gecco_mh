def cognitive_model2(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL with asymmetric learning and recency-based WM that decays with time, set size, and age.

    Idea:
    - RL has separate learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors.
    - WM stores recently rewarded state-action bindings; their influence decays with the time since
      last successful encoding. Decay rate grows with set size and with age.
    - WM policy is precise when information is fresh; otherwise RL dominates.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - alpha_pos: RL learning rate for positive PE (0..1)
    - alpha_neg: RL learning rate for negative PE (0..1)
    - softmax_beta: base inverse temperature for RL policy (scaled by 10)
    - decay_base: base WM recency decay rate per trial (>=0)
    - size_decay_gain: multiplicative gain of decay with set size load (>=0)
    - age_decay_gain: additional multiplicative gain of decay for older adults (>=0)

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed actions.
