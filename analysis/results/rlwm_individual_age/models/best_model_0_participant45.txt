def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL + capacity-limited WM with age and set-size dependent arbitration and WM forgetting.

    Idea:
    - RL: standard Q-learning with softmax policy.
    - WM: state-action template that is set to the last rewarded action and otherwise forgets (drifts to uniform).
    - Arbitration: fixed WM weight reduced by (a) larger set sizes and (b) older age.
    - Age group: older adults receive an additional penalty on WM contribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    states : array-like of int
        State identity on each trial (0..nS-1 within each block).
    actions : array-like of int
        Chosen action on each trial (0..2).
    rewards : array-like of float/int
        Feedback on each trial (0 or 1).
    blocks : array-like of int
        Block index for each trial.
    set_sizes : array-like of int
        Set size for the block on each trial (3 or 6).
    age : array-like (single repeated value)
        Participant age (repeated). Age group: 0 if <=45 (young), 1 otherwise (old).
    model_parameters : list or array
        [lr, beta_base, wm_weight_base, wm_forget, ss6_penalty, age_wm_delta]
        - lr: RL learning rate (0..1).
        - beta_base: RL inverse temperature (scaled internally by 10).
        - wm_weight_base: baseline WM influence (0..1).
        - wm_forget: WM drift toward uniform when no rewarded update occurs (0..1).
        - ss6_penalty: WM weight penalty applied when set size == 6 (>=0).
        - age_wm_delta: additional WM penalty applied to older adults (>=0).

    Returns
    -------
    nll : float
        Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
