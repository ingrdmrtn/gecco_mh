def cognitive_model2(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    Asymmetric RL + outcome-gated WM + state-specific stickiness.

    Mechanism:
    - RL: tabular Q-learning with separate learning rates for positive vs negative prediction errors.
    - WM: fast mapping stored when rewarded; decays over time. WM weight increases after reward trials.
      WM reliance is reduced for older adults and larger set sizes (fixed functional penalty).
    - Stickiness: within-state tendency to repeat the last chosen action, modeled as an additive bias.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr_pos: learning rate for positive prediction errors (0..1).
    - lr_neg: learning rate for negative prediction errors (0..1).
    - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature; scaled by 10 internally.
    - wm_weight_base: base WM mixture weight (0..1).
    - wm_reward_boost: multiplicative boost of WM weight on rewarded trials (>=0).
    - stickiness: additive bias (in value units) to repeat the last action in the same state (can be +/-).

    Age and load effects:
    - WM weight is divided by (1 + (nS-3) + age_group), reducing it under higher load and in older adults.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
