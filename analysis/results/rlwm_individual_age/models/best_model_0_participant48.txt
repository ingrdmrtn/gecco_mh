def cognitive_model2(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with perseveration bias; age increases perseveration and reduces WM weight under load.

    This model adds a perseveration bias to the RL system that favors repeating the last action
    taken in the same state. WM has decay and contributes via a mixture whose strength declines
    with set size and is reduced further in older adults.

    Parameters
    ----------
    states : array-like, int
        State index on each trial (0..nS-1, per block).
    actions : array-like, int
        Chosen action on each trial (0..2).
    rewards : array-like, int
        Binary feedback on each trial (0 or 1).
    blocks : array-like, int
        Block index for each trial.
    set_sizes : array-like, int
        Set size for each block (3 or 6), repeated in the block.
    age : array-like, int
        Participant age (same value repeated). Age group is 0 if <=45, else 1.
    model_parameters : list or array
        [lr, softmax_beta, wm_weight_base, wm_decay, perseveration_beta, age_effect]
        - lr: RL learning rate (0..1)
        - softmax_beta: base RL inverse temperature (scaled up internally)
        - wm_weight_base: baseline WM contribution at set size 3
        - wm_decay: WM decay toward uniform (0..1 per trial)
        - perseveration_beta: strength of perseveration bias added to RL preferences
        - age_effect: increases perseveration and reduces WM in older adults

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
