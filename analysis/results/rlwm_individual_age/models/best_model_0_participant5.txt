    """
    Cognitive Model 1: Hybrid RL + Reward-gated WM with set size and age-modulated WM weighting.
    
    Description:
    - RL: Q-learning with softmax action selection.
    - WM: Reward-gated one-hot memory that decays toward uniform baseline; policy via near-deterministic softmax.
    - Mixture: Action probability is a convex combination of WM and RL policies.
    - Set size effect: WM mixture weight decreases with larger set sizes via a power-law factor.
    - Age effect: Older group has reduced WM contribution.

    Parameters (list):
    - lr: RL learning rate (0..1)
    - wm_weight_base: Base mixture weight for WM (0..1), modulated by set size and age
    - softmax_beta: Inverse temperature for RL (scaled up internally)
    - wm_lr: WM learning rate towards one-hot after reward (0..1)
    - ss_slope: Exponent controlling how strongly set size reduces WM weight (>=0)
    
    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
