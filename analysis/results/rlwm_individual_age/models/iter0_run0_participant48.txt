    RL+WM mixture with age- and load-dependent WM weighting, and WM decay.

    This model mixes a standard Rescorla-Wagner RL system with a capacity-limited,

    on set size (higher for 3 than 6) and is additionally shifted by age group.

        Set size for each block (3 or 6), repeated across trials within a block.
    age : array-like, int
        Participant age (same value repeated). Age group is 0 if <=45, else 1.
    model_parameters : list or array
        [lr, wm_weight_small, wm_weight_large, softmax_beta, wm_decay, age_wm_shift]
        - lr: RL learning rate (0..1)

    Uncertainty-gated arbitration between RL and WM with lapse; age and load modulate gating and lapses.

    This model computes a trial-wise arbitration weight for WM based on the relative certainty
    of WM vs RL. WM certainty is higher when WM distribution is peaked (low entropy); RL certainty
    is approximated by the value spread in Q. Gating is passed through a sigmoid with an age-dependent
    bias and a load-dependent slope. A small lapse rate mixes in uniform choice, increasing with age
    and set size.
