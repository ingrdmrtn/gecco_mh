Below are three standalone RL+WM cognitive models that compute the negative log-likelihood of the observed choices. Each model uses age group and set size in different, theoretically motivated ways and adheres to the requested template structure.

Note: These functions assume numpy is already imported as np.

def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with capacity-limited WM.
    - RL learns state-action values via a single learning rate.
    - WM stores correct responses one-shot upon reward and is then near-deterministic.
    - WM contribution is capacity-limited: larger set sizes reduce effective WM weight via a logistic capacity function.
    - Age modulates WM capacity: older group has reduced effective capacity.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    states : array-like
        State index at each trial (0..set_size-1 for the current block).
    actions : array-like
        Chosen actions at each trial (0..2).
    rewards : array-like
        Binary rewards at each trial (0/1).
    blocks : array-like
        Block index per trial. Within a block, set size is constant.
    set_sizes : array-like
        Set size for the block in which each trial resides (3 or 6).
    age : array-like
        Participant age per trial (constant across trials).
    model_parameters : list/tuple
        [lr, wm_weight, softmax_beta, capacity_c, capacity_k]
        - lr: RL learning rate (0..1)
        - wm_weight: baseline WM mixture weight before set-size/age adjustments (0..1)
        - softmax_beta: inverse temperature for RL policy (scaled by 10 internally)
        - capacity_c: WM capacity center (around items). Larger c -> more WM engagement at larger set sizes.
        - capacity_k: sigmoid steepness for capacity drop with set size. Larger -> steeper drop.
    
    Returns

    float
        Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.

Model notes and how set size and age affect parameters:
- cognitive_model1: WM weight is gated by a logistic function of set size around a capacity parameter capacity_c with steepness capacity_k. Older participants have an effectively lower capacity (age reduces c_eff), so the WM contribution drops more quickly as set size increases.
- cognitive_model2: WM weight is scaled by a power-law (3/nS)^phi, and older participants have a multiplicative reduction in WM reliance. RL uses asymmetric learning rates for gains vs. losses. Includes a lapse parameter that adds random choice noise.
- cognitive_model3: Arbitration weight for WM increases with RL uncertainty (entropy) and decreases with set size; WM decays more with larger set size. Age modulates WM reliance multiplicatively: young participants rely more, older less.

All models:
- Use age group coding meaningfully in arbitration/WM gating.
- Incorporate set size into WM gating or decay.
- Respect the given RL+WM template, including deterministic WM softmax and RL softmax.
- Return negative log-likelihood of the observed choices.
