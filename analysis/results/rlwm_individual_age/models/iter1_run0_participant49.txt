    """
    RL+WM mixture with asymmetric RL learning rates and set-size/age-dependent WM interference.

    Idea
    - RL: Q-learning with separate positive and negative learning rates (captures older adults’
      reduced learning from negative outcomes).
    - WM: fast one-shot encoding of the last rewarded action per state, but subject to interference
      that increases with set size and age.
    - Mixture: action probability is a convex combination of RL softmax and WM softmax.
      The WM weight is the base weight scaled down by interference that depends on set size and age.

    blocks : array-like

    set_sizes : array-like
        Set size per trial (3 or 6).
    age : array-like
        Participant age (same value repeated).
    model_parameters : list or array
        [lr_pos, lr_neg, wm_base, beta_base, interference]
        - lr_pos: RL learning rate for positive prediction errors (0..1).

    RL+WM mixture with probabilistic WM availability (win-stay store) controlled by set size and age.

    Idea
    - RL: standard Q-learning with a single learning rate.
    - WM: a simple "win-stay" store. When a state-action is rewarded, WM stores that action.
      WM is available on a trial with probability that decreases with set size and age.
    - Policy: When WM is available, use a near-deterministic WM softmax; otherwise use RL softmax.
      This is implemented as an expected-mixture with an availability weight.
    - Availability decreases sigmoidally with (set size - 3) and age group.

    """
    RL+WM mixture with uncertainty-gated WM contribution, age-scaled WM baseline, and lapse.

    Idea
    - RL: standard Q-learning.
    - WM: graded value map that encodes the currently believed best action, with mild precision.
      WM decays toward uniform each trial; decay increases with set size, and the WM baseline weight
      is reduced in older adults.
    - Gating: the effective WM mixture weight increases when RL is uncertain (high entropy), and
      decreases when RL is confident (low entropy). This captures strategic reliance on WM early.
    - Lapse: a small set-size- and age-independent lapse probability adds uniform choice noise.
