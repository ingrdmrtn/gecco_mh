    RL + WM with time-since-visit decay and uncertainty-based arbitration.

    Idea:
    - RL learns Q-values with a single learning rate.
    - WM stores one-shot rewarded associations, but memory traces decay as a function of
      time since the state was last visited. Decay is stronger for larger set sizes and
      for older adults.
    - Arbitration weight for WM equals its instantaneous reliability, which is computed
      from the same decay function (more decay -> lower reliability).
    - Policy is a mixture of RL softmax and (nearly) deterministic WM softmax.

    Parameters
    ----------
    states : array-like of int

        Set size per trial (3 or 6).
    age : array-like of int
        Participant age repeated per trial. Age group is coded: 0 if <=45, 1 if >45.
    model_parameters : list or array
        [lr, softmax_beta, wm_reliability_base, wm_decay_base, age_decay_delta, setsize_decay_slope]
        - lr: RL learning rate (0..1).
        - softmax_beta: inverse temperature for RL; internally scaled by x10.
        - wm_reliability_base: base WM reliability (0..1) when no decay is applied.

    RL with eligibility trace + gated WM by prediction-error magnitude.

    Idea:
    - RL: single learning rate, but with an eligibility trace that keeps a short-term
      trace of the last chosen action within each state. This allows small spillover
      to nonchosen actions within the visited state, controlled by lambda.
    - WM: stores one-shot associations only when the unsigned prediction error is high,
      with a gate threshold that depends on age and set size (older adults and larger
      set sizes raise the threshold, reducing WM engagement).
    - Arbitration: the WM gate probability (sigmoid of PE minus threshold) is used as
      the mixture weight between WM and RL policies.

    RL + WM with capacity-scaled WM weight and age/set-size dependent lapse.

    Idea:
    - RL learns Q-values (single lr).
    - WM stores the most recent rewarded action per state (win-stay memory) without decay.
      If no rewarded action is stored for a state, WM is effectively uniform.
    - WM influence (mixture weight) is scaled by capacity pressure: higher for small set size,
      lower for large set size (3/nS). 
    - A lapse process (state-independent random responding) depends on age group and set size:
      older adults and larger set sizes increase lapse probability.
