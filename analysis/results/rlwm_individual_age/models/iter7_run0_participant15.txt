    """
    RL with eligibility-like recency and slot-limited WM with refresh; arbitration with bias and lapse.

    Overview:
    - Policy is a mixture of RL and WM policies with an age- and load-sensitive arbitration and a small lapse.
    - RL uses a delta rule and a mild recency factor (like a simple eligibility-like persistence).
    - WM is slot-limited: when set size exceeds capacity, WM precision is diluted.
    - WM is refreshed each trial toward a one-hot at the last rewarded action in that state.
    - Arbitration weight favors WM when set size is small and for younger adults; includes a bias parameter.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: RL learning rate in [0,1]
    - beta_rl: RL inverse temperature; internally scaled by 10
    - wm_slot_cap: effective WM slots (>=1). Determines dilution at larger set sizes
    - wm_refresh: WM refresh/strengthening rate in [0,1] when reward is delivered
    - arb_bias: baseline arbitration bias toward WM in [0,1]
    - lapse_base: base lapse probability in [0,1]; increases with set size and age

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.

    - RL: separate learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors.
    - WM: one-shot encoding with probability p_enc that decreases with set size and age.

    - Arbitration: WM weight scales with RL uncertainty (higher entropy → more WM) and with encoding success.
