    """
    Simulate choices and rewards from the RL+WM model with valence-specific learning,
    set-size–dependent decision noise, and reward-gated WM contribution.

    Arguments:
    - stimulus: sequence of stimuli (state indices) for each trial (array of int)
    - blocks: block index for each trial (array of int)
    - set_sizes: block-dependent set sizes on each trial (array of int)
    - correct_answer: correct action on each trial (array of int)
    - age: participant's age (array, single repeated value)
    - parameters: [alpha_pos, alpha_neg, wm_weight, softmax_beta, beta_set_cost, gate]

    Returns:
    - simulated_actions: simulated action choices (array of int)
    - simulated_rewards: simulated binary rewards (array of int)
