    """
    Simulate actions and rewards using the RL(α) with eligibility traces, age-modulated decay,
    stochastic WM gating under load, and action stickiness.

    Arguments:
    - stimulus: sequence of stimuli for each trial (array of ints: state indices 0..nS-1)
    - blocks: block index for each trial (array)
    - set_sizes: set size for each trial (array, constant within a block: 3 or 6)
    - correct_answer: correct action for each trial (array of ints 0..2; constant per state within block)
    - age: participant's age (array, single repeated value)
    - parameters: [alpha, softmax_beta, lambda_trace, beta_wm_gate, sigma_gate_age, kappa_stick]

    Returns:
    - simulated_actions: simulated action choices (array of ints)
    - simulated_rewards: simulated binary rewards (array of ints)
