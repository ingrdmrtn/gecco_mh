def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    Surprise-gated RL+WM with load-dependent arbitration and load-driven WM decay.

    Idea:
    - Model-free RL with a single learning rate and softmax policy.
    - A fast, one-shot Working Memory (WM) store that is updated more when surprise is high.
    - Arbitration weight for WM increases with surprise but decreases with set size (load).
    - WM globally decays toward uniform per trial; decay increases with load using the same
      load_scale parameter.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: [0,1] RL learning rate.
    - softmax_beta: >=0 RL inverse temperature (internally scaled by 10).
    - wm_base: base log-odds bias in favor of WM arbitration (higher -> more WM).
    - surprise_gain: >=0 scales how much reward prediction error (surprise) gates WM.
    - load_scale: >=0 scales how strongly larger set sizes reduce WM contributions and increase decay.
    - wm_learn: [0,1] strength of WM encoding on each trial when updated.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed actions.
