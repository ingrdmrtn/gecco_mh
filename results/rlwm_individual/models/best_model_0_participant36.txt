    """
    RL + Bayesian WM with load- and surprise-adaptive arbitration.

    Overview:
    - RL system: delta-rule Q-learning with softmax policy.
    - WM system: per-state Dirichlet memory over actions (concentrations), yielding a
      probability distribution over actions. Rewarded outcomes increase concentration
      for the chosen action; non-reward spreads small mass to alternatives.
    - Arbitration: WM weight decreases with set size (load_sens) and increases with
      surprise |delta| (surprise_gain). Mixture of WM and RL policies forms choice prob.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: RL learning rate for Q-values (0..1).
    - wm_weight0: Base WM mixture weight at low load (0..1).
    - softmax_beta: Inverse temperature for RL softmax (scaled by 10 internally).
    - wm_precision: Amount added to WM concentration for reinforced actions (>=0).
    - surprise_gain: Gain scaling for transient WM up-weighting by |prediction error| (>=0).
    - load_sens: Sensitivity of WM usage to set size > 3 (>=0). Larger values down-weight WM for larger sets.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of the observed choices.
