def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with capacity-limited working memory, WM decay, and WM learning rate.

    The model mixes a standard model-free RL policy with a working-memory (WM) policy.
    The WM policy is strong (high inverse temperature), but its contribution is limited
    by a capacity parameter that scales with set size. WM traces also decay toward uniform.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_parameters: tuple of 6 floats
        lr:            Learning rate for RL value updates (0..1).
        wm_weight:     Base mixture weight of WM vs RL (0..1).
        softmax_beta:  Inverse temperature for RL softmax (scaled internally).
        wm_decay:      Decay of WM toward uniform per trial (0..1).
        wm_lr:         WM learning rate when a rewarded association is observed (0..1).
        wm_capacity:   Effective WM capacity in number of state-action pairs (e.g., 1..6).
                       The WM weight is scaled by min(1, wm_capacity / set_size).

    Returns
    -------
    Negative log-likelihood of the observed choices under the model.
