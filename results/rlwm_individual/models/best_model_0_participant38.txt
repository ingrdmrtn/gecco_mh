def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL + WM with prediction-error-gated arbitration and load-modulated gating.

    Mechanism:
    - RL learns action values per state via a Rescorla-Wagner rule.
    - WM stores a supervised mapping for rewarded actions, decays toward uniform after non-reward.
    - Arbitration weight for WM is dynamically reduced by the absolute RL prediction error (|PE|),
      with stronger reduction under higher load (nS). This captures that surprising outcomes and
      higher cognitive load push the system to rely more on RL rather than WM.

    Parameters (total 6):
    - lr: RL learning rate in [0,1].
    - wm_weight: Baseline WM arbitration weight in [0,1] before gating.
    - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature; internally scaled by 10.
    - pe_gate: Sensitivity of WM weight to absolute prediction error (>=0).
    - wm_decay: WM decay rate toward uniform after non-reward in [0,1].
    - wm_learn: WM supervised learning rate toward one-hot after reward in [0,1].

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
