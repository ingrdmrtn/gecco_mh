    """
    RL+WM capacity-and-forgetting model (slot-like WM + model-free RL).
    
    The choice policy is a mixture of a reinforcement-learning (RL) policy and a working-memory (WM) policy.
    - RL: standard delta-rule on Q-values with softmax choice.
    - WM: slot-like memory of correct action per state with decay toward uniform; high inverse temperature for WM.
    - Arbitration: WM weight is scaled by an effective capacity term K/nS (capped at 1), so WM contributes less in larger set sizes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_parameters: tuple/list of 5 floats
        lr               : RL learning rate (0..1).
        wm_capacity      : WM capacity in number of items (e.g., 1..6); effective WM weight scales as min(1, wm_capacity / set_size).
        softmax_beta     : Base inverse temperature for RL (rescaled by 10 inside the model).
        wm_decay         : WM decay toward uniform per trial (0..1). Larger = faster forgetting.
        lapse            : Lapse rate for WM policy (0..1), mixing a uniform policy into WM to avoid overconfidence.

    Returns
    -------
    nll : float
        Negative log-likelihood of the observed choices under the model.
