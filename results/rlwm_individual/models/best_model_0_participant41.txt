def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM with graded WM capacity and decay.
    - RL: single learning rate with softmax choice.
    - WM: fast delta-rule with decay and capacity-limited weight.
    - Mixture: choice probability is a convex combination of WM and RL policies,
      where the effective WM weight scales with set size via a capacity parameter.

    Parameters (6):
    - lr: RL learning rate in [0,1].
    - wm_weight: baseline WM mixture weight in [0,1] (weight at low load before capacity scaling).
    - softmax_beta: inverse temperature for RL (will be internally scaled; higher -> more deterministic).
    - wm_decay: per-visit decay of WM entries toward the uniform prior (0=no decay, 1=full reset).
    - k_wm: WM capacity (in items); WM weight scales approximately with min(1, k_wm / set_size).
    - wm_lr: WM learning rate in [0,1] for delta-rule updating of WM associations.

    Set size effects:
    - Effective WM weight per trial is wm_weight * min(1, k_wm / nS), so WM contributes more in set size=3 than in set size=6.
    - RL softmax temperature is not directly set-size dependent here (only WM weight is).

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of the observed choices under the model.
