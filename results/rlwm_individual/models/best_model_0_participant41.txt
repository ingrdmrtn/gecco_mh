def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL + one-shot Working Memory (WM) with set-size-dependent decay and lapse.

    This model mixes:
    - A standard model-free RL learner (softmax over Q-values, updated with lr).
    - A one-shot WM cache that encodes the last rewarded action per state and decays toward uniform.
      WM efficacy deteriorates under higher set size via stronger decay and higher lapse.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_parameters : tuple of 5 floats
        lr : RL learning rate in [0,1].
        wm_weight : Mixture weight in [0,1] for WM policy versus RL policy.
        softmax_beta : Inverse temperature for RL policy (scaled internally by 10).
        wm_decay_base : Base decay toward uniform for WM row update in [0,1]. Effective decay is larger when set size is larger.
        wm_lapse_base : Base WM lapse (mixture with uniform) in [0,1]. Effective lapse increases with set size.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Negative log-likelihood of the observed choices under the model.
