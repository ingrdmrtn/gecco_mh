def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL + WM with eligibility traces and set-size interference.

    Mechanism:
    - RL: tabular Q-learning augmented with an eligibility trace over state-action pairs.
      This allows credit to persist beyond the current (s,a) and accelerates learning with repetition.
    - WM: fast one-shot encoding toward the chosen action when rewarded, acting like a cached mapping.
      Its contribution to choice is reduced by set-size-dependent interference.
    - Arbitration: convex mixture between RL and WM policies. The WM weight is downscaled as:
          wm_weight_eff = wm_weight / (1 + interference * (nS - 1))
      Larger nS produces more interference and less WM influence.

    Parameters (in order):
    - lr: RL learning rate in [0,1].
    - wm_weight: Baseline mixture weight on WM in [0,1].
    - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (scaled by 10 internally).
    - trace: Eligibility trace decay (lambda) in [0,1]; higher sustains broader credit assignment.
    - interference: Set-size interference coefficient >=0 controlling WM weight downscaling with nS.
    - enc_gain: WM encoding gain in [0,1]; strength of shifting WM toward chosen action on reward.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
