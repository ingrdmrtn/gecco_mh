def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL + WM with surprise-gated WM encoding and load-modulated forgetting.

    Idea:
    - RL learns action values via delta rule and softmax.
    - WM stores a one-shot policy per state when outcomes are surprising and rewarding.
    - Surprise is approximated from the current state's RL certainty: surprise ≈ 1 - max(Q_s).
    - WM decay increases with load (larger set size => faster forgetting).
    - Arbitration between WM and RL is gated by surprise: more surprise => rely more on WM.

    Parameters:
    - lr: RL learning rate in [0,1].
    - wm_weight_base: Base weight for WM contribution in [0,1].
    - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (scaled internally x10).
    - wm_forget: Baseline WM forgetting rate in [0,1]. Larger => faster decay toward uniform.
    - pe_sensitivity: Surprise sensitivity (>=0). Scales the sigmoid that maps surprise to WM arbitration and storage strength.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
