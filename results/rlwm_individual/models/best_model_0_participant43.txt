def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL + WM mixture with capacity scaling and decay.

    Idea:
    - RL learns Q-values with a standard delta rule.
    - WM stores the last rewarded response for each state (one-shot), but memory decays toward uniform.
    - WM influence is reduced when set size exceeds a capacity parameter.
    
    Parameters (tuple):
    - lr: RL learning rate (0..1)
    - wm_weight: baseline mixture weight for WM (0..1)
    - softmax_beta: inverse temperature for RL policy (positive); internally scaled by 10
    - wm_decay: per-trial decay of WM map toward uniform (0..1)
    - capacity_k: WM capacity in number of items; effective WM weight is scaled by min(1, capacity_k / set_size)
