def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with capacity-limited WM and decay toward uniform.
    - RL: single learning rate (lr) and softmax inverse temperature (softmax_beta).
    - WM: item-based store per state with one-shot storage for rewarded actions,
          elimination for unrewarded actions, and decay toward uniform (wm_decay).
    - Mixture weight depends on set size via a capacity parameter K:
      effective_wm_weight = wm_weight * min(1, K / nS). Thus, larger set sizes reduce WM influence.

    Parameters (tuple):
    - lr: scalar in [0,1], RL learning rate for Q-values.
    - wm_weight: scalar in [0,1], base weight on WM policy in the choice mixture.
    - softmax_beta: scalar >= 0, RL inverse temperature (internally scaled by 10).
    - K: positive scalar, effective WM capacity (number of items that can be strongly maintained).
    - wm_decay: scalar in [0,1], per-decision decay of WM values toward uniform (applied on visited state).

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of the observed choices under the model.
