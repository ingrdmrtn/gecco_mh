    """
    RL + one-shot Working Memory with set-size-dependent mixture and decay

    Mixture policy combines:
    - Model-free RL Q-learning
    - A working-memory (WM) store that encodes rewarded stimulus-action pairs via one-shot learning,
      with passive decay toward uniform.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_parameters : list or array-like of length 6
        lr : float
            RL learning rate for Q-learning (0..1).
        wm_weight_small : float
            Mixture weight for WM in small set size blocks (nS=3).
        wm_weight_large : float
            Mixture weight for WM in large set size blocks (nS=6).
        softmax_beta : float
            Inverse temperature for RL softmax (will be multiplied by 10 internally).
        wm_decay : float
            Passive decay rate of WM toward uniform on each trial (0..1).
        wm_store : float
            One-shot storage strength in WM when rewarded (0..1). 1.0 stores a near one-hot.

    Set-size effects
    ----------------
    - WM mixture weight depends on set size: wm_weight_small if nS=3, wm_weight_large if nS=6.
