def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL + graded working-memory (WM) mixture with capacity- and decay-adjusted WM.
    
    Idea:
    - RL learns action values via a delta rule with softmax choice.
    - WM maintains a fast but leaky value table for each state, updated by reward prediction error (same lr).
    - Arbitration is a mixture of RL and WM policies, but the WM weight and WM determinism both decrease with set size.
    
    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: Learning rate used for both RL and WM (0..1).
    - wm_weight: Base arbitration weight of WM vs RL (0..1). Effective weight is downscaled by capacity/nS.
    - softmax_beta: Inverse temperature for RL softmax (internally scaled by 10 per template).
    - wm_decay: Leak/decay of WM values toward the uniform prior at each trial (0..1).
    - wm_capacity: Effective WM capacity (e.g., ~3–4). WM influence scales by min(1, wm_capacity / set_size).
    
    Set size impact:
    - Effective WM weight per block: wm_weight_eff = wm_weight * min(1, wm_capacity / nS).
    - WM choice determinism (beta_wm) also effectively drops with large set size because WM values decay more
      relative to uniform when the state space is larger (via wm_decay and capacity scaling of wm_weight).
