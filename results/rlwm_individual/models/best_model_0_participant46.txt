def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RLWM model with capacity-limited, decaying one-shot working memory and RL integration.
    
    Policy: Mixture of RL softmax and WM softmax.
    - RL: tabular Q-learning with single learning rate and inverse temperature.
    - WM: one-shot storage of rewarded action for each state (deterministic policy),
          with trial-wise decay toward uniform and effective WM weight reduced by set size.

    Parameters
    - lr: scalar in [0,1], learning rate for RL Q-learning.
    - wm_weight: base mixture weight for WM (0..1). The effective WM weight is
                 wm_weight * min(1, wm_capacity / set_size) (reduced under higher load).
    - softmax_beta: inverse temperature for RL policy; internally scaled by 10 for a wide range.
    - wm_decay: decay (0..1) of WM table toward uniform each trial; higher means faster forgetting.
    - wm_capacity: capacity (in items) controlling how set size modulates the WM influence.

    Returns
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
