def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with one-shot WM encoding and decay, and set-size scaling of WM weight.

    Mechanism:
    - RL: Standard Rescorla–Wagner update with learning rate lr and softmax with inverse temperature beta.
    - WM: One-shot storage upon correct feedback (r=1): WM for that state becomes a one-hot vector favoring the chosen action.
          Otherwise, WM decays toward uniform with rate wm_decay. WM policy uses a near-deterministic softmax (beta_wm=50).
    - Mixture: Action probability is a convex combination of WM policy and RL policy with effective WM weight that
               decreases with set size.

    Parameters:
    - lr: RL learning rate (0..1)
    - wm_weight: Baseline WM mixture weight in small set size
    - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (scaled internally by 10)
    - wm_decay: WM decay rate toward uniform (0..1); larger means faster forgetting
    - wm_size_sensitivity: Exponent controlling how WM weight shrinks with set size; wm_eff = wm_weight * (3 / nS) ** wm_size_sensitivity

    Set-size effects:
    - As set size increases (from 3 to 6), wm_eff decreases according to wm_size_sensitivity, capturing reduced WM control
      under higher load.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of the observed choices.
