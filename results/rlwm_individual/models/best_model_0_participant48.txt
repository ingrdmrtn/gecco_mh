def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL + capacity-limited Working Memory (WM) mixture model.

    On each trial, action selection is a mixture of:
    - RL policy: softmax over Q-values (state-action values).
    - WM policy: softmax over a fast-learning, fast-decaying WM store W.
      WM weight is reduced as set size increases, implementing capacity limits.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: scalar in [0,1], RL learning rate for Q-values.
    - wm_weight: scalar in [0,1], base mixture weight on WM when set size is low.
    - softmax_beta: inverse temperature for RL policy; internally scaled by 10.
    - wm_lr: scalar in [0,1], WM learning rate (fast one-shot update).
    - wm_decay: scalar in [0,1], per-trial decay of WM toward uniform baseline.
    - capacity_k: nonnegative scalar controlling how strongly WM weight drops with larger set size.
                  WM effective weight = wm_weight * sigmoid(-capacity_k*(nS-3)).

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed actions given the model.
