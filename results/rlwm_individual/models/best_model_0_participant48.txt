def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid RL + WM with set-size–scaled WM decay and state-specific choice stickiness.

    Mechanism:
    - RL: tabular Q-learning with a single learning rate.
    - WM: one-shot storage of rewarded state-action associations; continuous decay toward uniform that accelerates with set size.
    - Choice stickiness: within each state, a bias toward repeating the last chosen action (implemented in the WM policy).
    - Arbitration: fixed WM mixture weight.

    Parameters:
    - lr: RL learning rate (0..1)
    - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (scaled internally by 10)
    - omega0: baseline WM mixture weight in choice (0..1)
    - rho: base WM decay factor per trial (0..1); effective decay increases with set size
    - kappa_stick: strength of within-state choice stickiness added to WM policy (>=0)

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
