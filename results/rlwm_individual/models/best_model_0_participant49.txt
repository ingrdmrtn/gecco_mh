def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL + capacity-limited working memory (WM) mixture model.

    Idea:
    - Choices come from a mixture of a slow RL system and a fast WM system.
    - WM stores the most recently rewarded action per state with decay.
    - WM contribution is reduced under higher set size due to a limited capacity K and load sensitivity phi.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: RL learning rate in [0,1]
    - wm_weight: Base WM mixture weight in [0,1]
    - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (>0); internally scaled by 10 for range
    - wm_capacity: Effective WM capacity K (1..6), down-weights WM when nS > K
    - wm_decay: WM decay parameter in [0,1], controls how quickly WM traces decay toward uniform
    - wm_load_sensitivity: Exponent phi >= 0, how sharply WM weight declines with set size (mixture scaled by (K/nS)^phi)

    Set-size dependence:
    - Effective mixture weight per block: wm_weight_block = wm_weight * min(1, (wm_capacity / nS) ** wm_load_sensitivity)
      so larger nS reduces the WM contribution.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed actions.
