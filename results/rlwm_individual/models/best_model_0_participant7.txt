def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL + WM with load-induced interference and graded error-based encoding.

    Idea
    - RL learns Q-values with a single learning rate and softmax choice.
    - WM stores state-specific action distributions but suffers from load-induced interference
      that blends each state's WM with the block-average (stronger at nS=6 vs nS=3).
    - WM updates are graded: rewards push WM toward the chosen action; non-rewards push WM
      slightly away from the chosen action (error-based encoding).
    - The effective contribution of WM to choice is scaled down by load (via interference),
      and WM has its own inverse-temperature scale.

    Parameters
    ----------
    states : array-like of int
        State on each trial (0..nS-1 within block).
    actions : array-like of int
        Chosen action on each trial (0..2).
    rewards : array-like of {0,1}
        Binary feedback.
    blocks : array-like of int
        Block index.
    set_sizes : array-like of int
        Set size per trial (3 or 6).
    model_parameters : tuple
        (lr, wm_weight_base, softmax_beta, interference, wm_beta_scale)
        - lr: RL learning rate in [0,1]
        - wm_weight_base: baseline mixture weight for WM in [0,1]
        - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (>0); internally scaled up
        - interference: load-induced WM interference strength (>=0), higher means more blending across items
        - wm_beta_scale: scales WM inverse temperature (>0); WM beta = 10 * wm_beta_scale

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
