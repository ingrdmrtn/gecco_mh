def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, model_parameters):
    """
    RL with eligibility trace + WM mixture with set-size logistic arbitration.

    Idea:
    - RL: delta-rule learning with an eligibility trace (within-block), allowing credit to
      propagate to recent state-action pairs.
    - WM: fast, decay-prone table that stores rewarded associations.
    - Arbitration: WM weight decreases with set size via a logistic function, capturing load effects.

    Parameters (6 total):
    - lr: RL learning rate (0..1).
    - wm_weight0: Base scale for WM contribution (0..1).
    - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature; internally scaled by 10 for sensitivity.
    - wm_decay: Per-trial WM decay toward uniform (0..1).
    - lambda_et: Eligibility trace decay (0..1), applied per trial; gamma is implicitly 1.
    - ns_alpha: Set-size sensitivity for WM arbitration; larger values reduce WM weight faster with nS.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
