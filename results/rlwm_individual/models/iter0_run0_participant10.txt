    RL+WM mixture with capacity-limited WM, decay, and negative-feedback repulsion.

    Idea:
    - Decisions are driven by a mixture of reinforcement learning (RL) and a working memory (WM) store.
    - WM has a capacity K; its contribution scales as min(1, K / set_size).
    - WM values decay toward uniform each time the state is visited.
    - Positive feedback writes a one-hot association into WM; negative feedback repels the chosen action.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: RL learning rate (0..1)
    - wm_weight: Base mixture weight for WM (0..1)
    - softmax_beta: Inverse temperature for RL choice (scaled internally by 10)
    - K: Effective WM capacity (1..6). Reduces WM contribution when set size > K.
    - wm_decay: WM decay toward uniform on each visit (0..1)
    - wm_neg: Strength of WM update on negative feedback (0..1). Pushes weight away from the chosen action.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of the observed choices.

    - Mixture weight is fixed per block but WM policy itself is noisier when interference is stronger.

    RL+WM with uncertainty-gated WM and capacity limit, plus lapse.

    Idea:
    - RL learns with a single learning rate.
    - WM stores rewarded associations; unrewarded trials decay WM toward uniform.
    - The contribution of WM is dynamically gated by RL uncertainty (state-wise entropy).
      When RL is uncertain (high entropy), the system relies more on WM.
    - Under high set size, WM is capacity-limited via K.
    - A small lapse parameter mixes in uniform random choice.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: RL learning rate (0..1)
    - wm_weight_base: Base WM weight (0..1) before gating and capacity scaling
    - softmax_beta: Inverse temperature for RL choice (scaled internally by 10)
    - K: WM capacity (1..6); reduces WM impact when set size > K
    - tau: Uncertainty-gating sensitivity (>0). Higher -> stronger modulation by RL entropy.
    - lapse: Lapse rate (0..0.2). Final mixture includes (lapse) uniform noise.
