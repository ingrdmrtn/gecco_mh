    RL+WM mixture with load-sensitive WM capacity and decay.

    The model mixes a standard RL softmax policy with a working-memory (WM) policy.
    WM has limited capacity and decays toward uniform under load. WM weight is
    reduced when set size exceeds capacity.

    Parameters (tuple):
    - lr: RL learning rate in [0,1].
    - wm_weight: Baseline weight of WM in [0,1] (maximal contribution when not capacity-limited).
    - softmax_beta: Inverse temperature for RL softmax (rescaled internally by 10).
    - wm_decay: WM decay rate in [0,1]; effective decay grows with set size.
    - wm_alpha: WM learning strength in [0,1] for updating remembered mapping and suppressing wrong action.
    - wm_capacity: WM capacity (in number of state–action pairs). Effective WM weight scales with min(1, capacity/nS).

    Returns:
