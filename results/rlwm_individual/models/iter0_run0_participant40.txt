    RL+WM mixture with capacity scaling and WM decay/store strength.

    The model mixes a standard model-free RL policy with a capacity-limited working-memory (WM) policy.
    The effective WM weight scales down when set size exceeds an internal capacity K. WM contents decay
    toward uniform and get strengthened upon reward with a configurable store strength.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_parameters : tuple/list of 6 floats
        lr : RL learning rate in [0,1].
        wm_weight : Base mixture weight for WM in [0,1] (before set-size scaling).
        softmax_beta : Inverse temperature for RL policy; internally scaled by 10.
        capacity_K : WM capacity (in number of stimuli), scales WM influence as min(1, K / set_size).
        wm_decay : Per-trial WM decay toward uniform in [0,1].
        wm_store : Strength of WM storage when rewarded in [0,1] (how much to move W toward one-hot).
