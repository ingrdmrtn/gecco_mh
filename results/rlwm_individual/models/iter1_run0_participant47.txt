Below are three standalone cognitive models that follow your template, differ in mechanisms and parameterizations, and return negative log-likelihoods. Each model uses all of its parameters and includes a WM component that behaves differently under set-size load.

Note: No imports are included; assume numpy as np is available.

    Model 1: Load-gated WM with leak and state-specific perseveration bias.
    - RL: Q-learning with softmax.
    - WM: leaky store toward uniform each trial; stores rewarded action; policy includes perseveration bias to repeat the last action in the same state.
    - Arbitration: Base WM weight is multiplicatively gated by set size using a logistic gate.

    Parameters:
      lr:               RL learning rate (0..1)
      wm_weight0:       Base mixture weight for WM before gating (0..1)
      softmax_beta:     RL inverse temperature (scaled internally; >=0)
      wm_leakage:       WM leak toward uniform per encounter (0..1); also sets storage strength via 1-exp(-5*wm_leakage)
      wm_gate_slope:    Slope (>0) of the logistic load gate that reduces WM weight as set size increases
      perseveration:    Strength (>=0) of same-state perseveration bias added to WM policy for the last chosen action
