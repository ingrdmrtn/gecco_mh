    Model 1: Dynamic arbitration via WM confidence and load penalty + PE-gated WM storage.
    - RL: standard Q-learning with single learning rate.
    - WM: probabilistic preference vector per state that decays toward uniform; storage is gated
      by the signed prediction error (PE). Reward strengthens the chosen action; no-reward gives
      mild demotion.
    - Arbitration: trial-wise WM weight is a sigmoid of WM confidence minus a load penalty.
      WM confidence is 1 - normalized entropy of WM policy for the current state.

    Parameters:
      lr:                RL learning rate (0..1)
      softmax_beta:      RL inverse temperature (scaled internally by 10; >=0)
      wm_decay:          WM leak toward uniform per encounter (0..1)
      gate_gain:         Sensitivity of WM update gate to signed PE (higher = more selective)
