    """
    RL(λ) with WM precision reduced by load (interference-based) and global decay.

    Idea
    - RL uses an eligibility trace to allow faster credit assignment across recently visited items.
    - WM encodes rewarded state-action pairs toward a one-hot, but its precision is reduced as set size grows
      via an interference parameter (phi_interf). Lower precision both:
        (a) reduces the effective WM inverse temperature, and
        (b) increases global decay toward uniform.
    - Mixture policy combines WM and RL with a fixed wm_weight.

    Parameters
    ----------
    states : array-like of int
        State index on each trial (0..nS-1 within block).
    actions : array-like of int
        Chosen action on each trial (0..2).
    rewards : array-like of {0,1}
        Binary feedback on each trial.
    blocks : array-like of int
        Block index for each trial.
    set_sizes : array-like of int
        Set size (3 or 6) for each trial.
    model_parameters : tuple
        (lr, wm_weight, softmax_beta, lambda_e, phi_interf)
        - lr: RL learning rate [0,1]
        - wm_weight: mixture weight of WM policy vs RL [0,1]
        - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (>0); internally scaled by 10
        - lambda_e: eligibility trace decay (0..1); higher spreads learning across recent visits
        - phi_interf: WM interference per extra item; larger values reduce WM precision with larger nS

    RL with load-adjusted WM mixture weight and persistent WM traces.

    Idea
    - RL uses a standard delta rule.
    - WM stores rewarded associations with an encoding strength; traces persist across trials with a persistence factor.
    - The influence of WM on choice is down-weighted by set size using a logistic transform:
        wm_weight_eff = sigmoid(logit(wm_weight_base) - load_gain * (nS - 3)).
      This captures reduced WM use under higher load while remaining within [0,1].

    RL with load-modulated exploration and WM confirmation counts.

    Idea
    - RL uses a delta rule, but its effective inverse temperature decreases with load,
      capturing noisier RL choices under higher set size.
      effective_beta = (softmax_beta * 10) / (1 + load_temp_slope * (nS - 3)).
    - WM tracks confirmation counts of rewarded actions per state. As evidence accumulates,
      WM distribution concentrates on the most confirmed action; once a count reaches k_confirm,
      WM becomes nearly deterministic for that state.
    - Policy is a mixture of RL and WM with a fixed wm_weight.
