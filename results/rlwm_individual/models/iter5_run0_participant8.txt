    RL + error-driven WM gating with set-size interference.

    Idea
    - RL: standard Q-learning with softmax.
    - WM: a cached mapping per state; policy is near-deterministic readout from WM.
    - Arbitration: WM weight increases with surprise (|prediction error|) on the current trial,
      and decreases linearly with set size (3/nS).
    - WM interference/forgetting increases with set size.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_parameters : (lr, wm_weight, softmax_beta, wm_gate_err, interference_rate)
        lr : float
            RL learning rate (0-1).
        wm_weight : float

        softmax_beta : float

        wm_gate_err : float
            Sensitivity of WM engagement to absolute RL prediction error (>=0).
            Larger values strengthen WM when the outcome is surprising.
