Below are three standalone cognitive models that follow your template structure. Each model mixes a delta-rule RL system with a working-memory (WM) system, but they differ in how WM availability/policy/updates depend on set size and experience. All functions return the negative log-likelihood of the observed choices.

Important implementation notes:
- I keep the RL policy line exactly as in your template (the softmax trick using Q_s - Q_s[a]).
- I define a WM policy p_wm similarly via a softmax on W_s with softmax_beta_wm.
- I blend policies using a block-level or trial-level wm_weight (possibly modulated by set size).
- I ensure numerical stability by lower bounding probabilities.
- All parameters are used meaningfully and total parameters per model are ≤ 6.

Model 1: RL + WM with recency-dependent WM decay and load-induced retrieval noise
- Idea: WM traces decay with time since last visit to a state, and retrieval becomes noisier as set size grows. Encoding is stronger for rewarded outcomes.
- Parameters:
  - lr: RL learning rate.
  - wm_weight: Base mixture weight of WM vs RL.
  - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (internally scaled by 10).
  - wm_time_decay: Rate at which WM decays with time-since-last-visit (per state).
  - wm_load_noise: Load-dependent scaling on WM noise (larger nS increases effective noise).

    RL + WM with recency (time-since-last-visit) decay and load-induced retrieval noise.

    Mechanisms:
    - RL: standard delta-rule with inverse temperature softmax.
    - WM: stores state-action associations, but decays back to uniform as a function
      of the time since last visit to that state and set size. Retrieval is less reliable
      with larger set sizes (load-induced noise).
    - Encoding: stronger on reward, weaker on no-reward.

    Parameters:
    - lr: RL learning rate (0..1).
    - wm_weight: Baseline WM mixture weight (0..1).
    - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (scaled internally by 10).
    - wm_time_decay: Recency-based WM decay rate per step (>=0).
    - wm_load_noise: Positive scaling of WM retrieval noise with set size (>=0).

Model 2: RL + WM with load-damped WM availability and attractor-like WM sharpening

  - wm_weight_base: Baseline WM mixture weight (pre-load).
  - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (internally scaled by 10).

  - wm_avail_base: Base WM availability factor (0..1) multiplied into wm_weight_base.

Model 3: RL + WM with confidence-based arbitration, set-size–dependent threshold, and lapse
- Idea: Use WM when it is confident; otherwise rely more on RL. Confidence is the margin between the top two WM entries. The WM-confidence threshold increases under higher load. A small lapse rate adds action noise.
- Parameters:
  - lr: RL learning rate.
  - wm_weight: Base WM mixture weight.
  - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (internally scaled by 10).
  - wm_conf_threshold: Base confidence threshold for WM gating.

How these models address load (3 vs 6):
- Model 1: WM decays faster effectively in larger sets (retrieval noise and larger gaps between visits to a given state). Thus, in set size 6, WM contributes less, pushing behavior toward RL.
- Model 2: WM availability is exponentially damped by set size, and its precision can be tuned by wm_sharpen. This directly reduces WM control in larger sets.
- Model 3: The WM-confidence threshold increases with set size, making it harder for WM to dominate when the set is large; epsilon further captures occasional lapses that might be more apparent under load.
