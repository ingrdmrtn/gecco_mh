    Simulate choices and rewards using Model 1: Dual-rate RL + WM mixture with set-size–specific WM weight and WM leak.

    Inputs:
    - stimulus: array of state indices per trial
    - blocks: array of block indices per trial
    - set_sizes: array of set size per trial (used to determine WM weight per block)
    - correct_answer: array of correct action per trial
    - parameters: [lr_pos, lr_neg, softmax_beta, wm_w_small, wm_w_large, wm_decay]

    Returns:
    - simulated_actions: array of simulated actions per trial
