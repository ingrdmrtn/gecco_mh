def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with one-shot WM learning and age- and set-size-dependent WM reliance.

    Idea:
    - Choices are driven by a mixture of incremental RL and a fast-working-memory (WM) store.
    - WM learns quickly from rewarded outcomes, and reverts toward uniform on non-reward.
    - The arbitration weight on WM decreases with higher set size (greater load) and differs by age group.
      Younger adults (age < 45) rely more on WM than older adults.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_parameters : array-like of length 6
        lr : RL learning rate (0..1)
        wm_bias : baseline logit for WM reliance (higher => more WM)
        softmax_beta : inverse temperature for RL policy (scaled internally)
        eta_wm : WM learning rate toward one-shot storage (0..1)
        setsize_slope : slope on (set_size - 3) for WM reliance (negative values reduce WM weight as set size increases)
        age_effect : additional logit shift if older (age >= 45). Positive values reduce WM in older if negative sign is used in formula below.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
