def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with capacity- and age-gated WM, plus lapse.
    - The WM policy is near-deterministic over a working memory table that stores
      the last rewarded action for each state (with decay and corrective updates after errors).
    - The mixture weight assigned to WM is scaled down when set size exceeds capacity
      and for older adults.
    - RL uses a single learning rate and softmax choice rule.

    Parameters
    ----------
    states : array-like of int
        State index on each trial (0..nS-1 within block).
    actions : array-like of int
        Chosen action on each trial (0..2).
    rewards : array-like of {0,1}
        Reward feedback on each trial.
    blocks : array-like of int
        Block index for each trial.
    set_sizes : array-like of int
        Set size per trial (e.g., 3 or 6), constant within a block.
    age : array-like (length 1)
        Participant age in years.
    model_parameters : list or array
        [lr, wm_weight, softmax_beta, wm_decay, wm_capacity, lapse]
        - lr: RL learning rate (0..1)
        - wm_weight: baseline WM mixture weight (0..1)
        - softmax_beta: inverse temperature for RL (scaled by 10 internally)
        - wm_decay: per-trial decay of WM weights toward uniform (0..1)
        - wm_capacity: WM capacity parameter controlling set-size gating
        - lapse: lapse rate to uniform responding (0..1)

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Negative log-likelihood of the observed choices under the model.
