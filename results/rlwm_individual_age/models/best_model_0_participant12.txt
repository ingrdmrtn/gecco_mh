def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with capacity-gated WM access and decay-based WM maintenance.
    - RL: single learning rate, softmax choice.
    - WM: decaying, reward-gated encoding of the last correct action per state,
          softmax choice with high inverse temperature.
    - Mixture: p_total = wm_weight_eff * p_wm + (1 - wm_weight_eff) * p_rl,
      where wm_weight_eff is down/up-weighted by a capacity gate based on set size and age group.

    Parameters
    ----------
    states : array-like, int
        State index on each trial (0..nS-1 within block).
    actions : array-like, int
        Chosen action (0..2).
    rewards : array-like, {0,1}
        Binary feedback.
    blocks : array-like, int
        Block index per trial (states do not repeat across blocks).
    set_sizes : array-like, int
        Set size for the trial's block (3 or 6).
    age : array-like or scalar
        Participant age in years. Age >= 45 = older group, else younger.
    model_parameters : sequence of 6 floats
        lr            : RL learning rate in [0,1].
        wm_weight     : Baseline WM mixture weight in [0,1].
        softmax_beta  : RL inverse temperature (will be scaled internally).
        phi_decay     : WM decay/encoding rate in [0,1].
        K_capacity    : WM capacity (effective states reliably maintained).
        age_bias      : Capacity bias added for younger and subtracted for older.

    Returns
    -------
    nll : float
        Negative log-likelihood of observed choices under the model.
