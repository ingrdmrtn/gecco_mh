def cognitive_model3(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM with probabilistic WM storage gate modulated by set size and age.

    Idea:
    - WM storage is probabilistic and depends on set size (harder to store at size 6).
    - Older adults have lower probability to store and maintain WM contents.
    - WM contributes via mixture with RL; both the WM mixture weight and storage probability
      are downscaled at larger set sizes.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: RL learning rate (0..1)
    - softmax_beta: RL inverse temperature (scaled internally)
    - wm_weight_base: Baseline WM mixture weight (0..1)
    - store_prob_base: Baseline probability to store WM on a rewarded trial (0..1)
    - wm_decay: WM decay toward uniform (0..1)
    - age_slope: Proportional reduction applied to both WM weight and storage for older adults (0..1)

    Inputs:
    - states, actions, rewards: trial-wise arrays
    - blocks: block index per trial
    - set_sizes: set size per trial
    - age: array with a single value
    - Returns: negative log-likelihood of observed actions
