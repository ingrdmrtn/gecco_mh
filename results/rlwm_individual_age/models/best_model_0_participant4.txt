def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with capacity penalty and age-modulated WM reliance.

    Combines:
    - Model-free RL (Q-learning) with a single learning rate.
    - Working-memory (WM) policy that stores the last rewarded action per state with decay/refresh.
    - Mixture of RL and WM depends on: (a) a base WM weight, (b) set size penalty (capacity pressure),
      and (c) age group (younger rely more on WM).

    Parameters
    ----------
    states : array-like of shape (T,)
        State index on each trial (0..nS-1 per block).
    actions : array-like of shape (T,)
        Chosen action on each trial (0..2).
    rewards : array-like of shape (T,)
        Binary feedback on each trial (0/1).
    blocks : array-like of shape (T,)
        Block index per trial.
    set_sizes : array-like of shape (T,)
        The set size presented on each trial (3 or 6). Constant within a block.
    age : array-like of shape (1,)
        Participant age; used to set age group (<45 = younger, >=45 = older).
    model_parameters : tuple/list
        (lr, wm_weight, softmax_beta, wm_decay, wm_penalty)
        - lr: RL learning rate (0..1).
        - wm_weight: Base WM mixture weight (0..1).
        - softmax_beta: Inverse temperature for RL policy (scaled inside).
        - wm_decay: WM encoding/decay strength (0..1). Larger = stronger overwrite toward the last rewarded action, and faster decay toward uniform when unrewarded.
        - wm_penalty: Capacity penalty applied when set size is large (0..1). Effective WM weight multiplied by (1 - wm_penalty) at set size 6.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Negative log-likelihood of observed choices under the model.
