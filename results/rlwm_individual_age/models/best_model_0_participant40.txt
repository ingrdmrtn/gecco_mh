def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with capacity- and age-adjusted WM, and WM decay.
    
    Model idea:
    - Choices are a mixture of an incremental RL system and a fast one-shot working memory (WM).
    - WM stores rewarded stimulus-action mappings and decays toward uniform.
    - WM influence is down-weighted when set size exceeds WM capacity K and for older adults.
    
    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: RL learning rate (0-1)
    - wm_weight: Base weight of WM contribution in the policy mixture (0-1)
    - softmax_beta: Inverse temperature for RL action selection (scaled internally)
    - wm_decay: Per-trial decay of WM values toward uniform (0-1)
    - capacity_K: WM capacity (e.g., 1-6)
    - age_bias: How strongly age group modulates WM weight (0-1). Older: down-weight by (1 - age_bias), Younger: up-weight by (1 + age_bias)
    
    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
