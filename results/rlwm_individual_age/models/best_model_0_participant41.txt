def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with capacity limit and age-adjusted WM, plus forgetting and lapse.
    
    The model assumes choices arise from a mixture of:
    - Reinforcement learning (RL): state-action Q-values updated with a learning rate.
    - Working memory (WM): one-shot storage of rewarded associations with decay.
    
    Mixture weight is modulated by set size (capacity pressure) and age group (older adults
    have effectively lower WM capacity). We also include a small lapse probability.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    states : array-like of int
        State index on each trial (0..set_size-1 within each block).
    actions : array-like of int
        Chosen action on each trial (0,1,2).
    rewards : array-like of {0,1}
        Binary feedback following the action.
    blocks : array-like of int
        Block index for each trial. States do not carry over across blocks.
    set_sizes : array-like of int
        The set size applicable to the current block (3 or 6).
    age : array-like (length 1)
        Participant age in years.
    model_parameters : iterable of floats
        [lr, wm_weight, softmax_beta, K, wm_decay, lapse]
        - lr: RL learning rate (0..1)
        - wm_weight: base WM mixture weight (0..1)
        - softmax_beta: inverse temperature for RL policy (scaled inside)
        - K: WM capacity proxy (in items)
        - wm_decay: WM decay rate toward new target on update (0..1), and toward uniform each trial
        - lapse: lapse probability mixing in uniform random choice (0..0.2)
    
    Returns
    -------
    float
        Negative log-likelihood of the observed choices under the model.
