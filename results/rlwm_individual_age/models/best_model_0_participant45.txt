def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with WM capacity, decay, and age-dependent WM engagement.

    The model blends a standard RL softmax policy with a working-memory (WM) policy.
    WM maintains a fast, one-shot mapping from state to action that decays over trials.
    WM engagement scales with effective set-size (capacity limit) and age group.

    Negative log-likelihood of observed choices is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    states : array-like of int
        State index per trial (0..nS-1 within a block).
    actions : array-like of int
        Chosen action per trial (0..2).
    rewards : array-like of {0,1}
        Binary feedback per trial.
    blocks : array-like of int
        Block index per trial. States do not carry over across blocks.
    set_sizes : array-like of int
        The set size of the current block (3 or 6), repeated per trial in that block.
    age : array-like of float
        Participant age (single value array). Used to modulate WM engagement; older adults (>45)
        rely less on WM.
    model_parameters : sequence of 6 floats
        lr : RL learning rate (0..1).
        wm_weight : Baseline WM mixture weight (0..1).
        softmax_beta : Inverse temperature for RL policy (scaled up internally).
        phi : WM decay rate toward uniform (0..1).
        K : WM capacity (in number of state-action mappings effectively supported).
        age_sensitivity : Controls how age shifts WM engagement (positive => older uses less WM).

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Negative log-likelihood of observed choices under the model.
