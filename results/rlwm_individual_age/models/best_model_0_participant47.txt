def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with age- and capacity-modulated WM contribution.

    Core idea:
    - Decisions arise from a mixture of reinforcement learning (RL) and working memory (WM).
    - WM is precise but capacity-limited and subject to decay; it contributes more in low set size.
    - Older adults (age >= 45) have reduced effective WM contribution and capacity.
    - RL updates are standard delta-rule.
    - The mixture weight adapts to set size via a capacity parameter.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: scalar in (0,1). RL learning rate for Q-values.
    - wm_weight_base: scalar in [0,1]. Base weight on WM policy.
    - softmax_beta: scalar > 0. Inverse temperature for RL policy (will be scaled internally).
    - wm_decay: scalar in [0,1]. WM decay rate toward uniform; larger = faster decay/forgetting.
    - k_capacity: scalar in [1,6]. Effective WM capacity in number of state-action associations.

    Inputs:
    - states: int array, trial-wise state indices.
    - actions: int array, trial-wise chosen actions (0..2).
    - rewards: int array, trial-wise rewards (0/1).
    - blocks: int array, trial-wise block index.
    - set_sizes: int array, trial-wise set size for the block (3 or 6).
    - age: array-like with a single value, participant age.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of the observed choices.
