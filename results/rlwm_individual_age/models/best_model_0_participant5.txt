def cognitive_model2(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL with valence-asymmetric learning + WM with interference and recency.

    Idea:
    - RL uses separate learning rates for positive vs. negative prediction errors (alpha+ and alpha-).
    - WM maintains a recency-weighted memory trace of rewarded actions per state, but suffers from
      set-size-dependent interference. Larger sets dilute WM via an interference parameter.
    - Age group modulates interference: older adults experience stronger interference.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr_pos: RL learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    - lr_neg: RL learning rate for negative prediction errors.
    - wm_weight: Base mixture weight for WM contribution.
    - softmax_beta: Inverse temperature for RL choice (internally scaled by 10 as per template).
    - wm_decay: Recency decay of WM toward uniform per trial.
    - interference: Strength of WM interference per additional item beyond 1 (scaled by set size and age).

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
