def cognitive_model1(states, actions, rewards, blocks, set_sizes, age, model_parameters):
    """
    RL+WM mixture with capacity-limited WM and age-sensitive gating.

    Idea:
    - Decisions arise from a mixture of incremental RL and a working-memory (WM) store.
    - WM encodes stimulus-action mappings when rewarded, but decays toward uniform over time.
    - WM contribution is scaled by set size via an effective capacity K that differs by age group.
      Younger: higher K; Older: lower K; effective WM weight scales as min(1, K/nS).
    - RL uses a Rescorla-Wagner update.
    
    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: RL learning rate in [0,1]
    - wm_weight: base mixing weight for WM contribution in [0,1]
    - softmax_beta: inverse temperature for RL policy (scaled internally by 10)
    - wm_decay: decay strength moving WM weights toward uniform each visit, in [0,1]
    - wm_noise: encoding noise on rewarded WM update (0=perfect one-hot; 1=uniform)
    
    Inputs:
    - states: array of state indices per trial (0..nS-1 inside a block)
    - actions: array of chosen actions per trial (0..2)
    - rewards: array of binary rewards per trial (0/1)
    - blocks: array of block indices per trial
    - set_sizes: array of set sizes per trial (3 or 6)
    - age: array-like with a single numeric age, age[0]
    
    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed actions under the model.
