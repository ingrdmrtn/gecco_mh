    RL+WM mixture with capacity- and age-modulated WM access and decay.

    Idea:
    - Choices are a mixture of model-free RL and a capacity-limited working memory (WM).
    - WM is more reliable in small set sizes and less so in large set sizes.
    - Age group modulates WM access: older adults have reduced WM access (scaled by age_effect),
      while younger adults use the base parameter.
    - WM stores the last rewarded action per state (one-shot encoding) with decay toward a uniform prior.

    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - lr: RL learning rate for Q-values.
    - wm_weight: Base mixture weight for WM contribution (will be modulated by set size and age).
    - softmax_beta: Inverse temperature for RL choice (internally scaled by 10 as per template).
    - wm_decay: Decay rate of WM toward uniform baseline each trial (0=no decay, 1=full reset).
    - capacity_k: Set-size threshold controlling WM access; higher values allow WM to operate at larger set sizes.
    - age_effect: Multiplicative reduction of WM access for older adults (>45). For younger, factor=1.
