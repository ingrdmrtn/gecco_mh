Here are three cognitive models representing different strategies for learning in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Free Learner (TD-Learning)
This model assumes the participant relies entirely on direct reinforcement (Model-Free learning). It uses Temporal Difference (TD) learning to update values. It does not use knowledge of the transition structure (the probabilities of reaching Planet X vs Y). It treats the first stage values purely based on the reward prediction error from the second stage.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Learner (TD-Learning).
    This model updates values based solely on experienced reward prediction errors,
    ignoring the transition structure of the task.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - The rate at which Q-values are updated (alpha).
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Q-values for Stage 1 (2 spaceships) and Stage 2 (2 planets x 2 aliens)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) 
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) 

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        # Softmax policy based on Model-Free values only
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        # Observe state (planet) transition
        state_idx = state[trial] # 0 or 1

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        # Softmax policy for the specific planet arrived at
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning ---
        # 1. Calculate Prediction Error for Stage 1 (TD(0))
        # The value of the chosen spaceship is updated toward the value of the chosen alien
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

        # 2. Calculate Prediction Error for Stage 2
        # The value of the chosen alien is updated toward the actual reward
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Based Learner
This model assumes the participant is a sophisticated planner. Instead of learning the value of spaceships directly from reward history, it calculates the value of a spaceship by combining the known transition probabilities (70/30) with the current values of the aliens on the planets. It plans forward rather than looking backward.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Learner.
    This model computes Stage 1 values by explicitly using the transition matrix
    to calculate the expected value of the best action at Stage 2.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for Stage 2 (alien) values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    # We only track Q-values for the aliens (Stage 2). 
    # Stage 1 values are computed on the fly.
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # Stage 1 values are strictly derived, not learned.

        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner (Model-Free + Model-Based) with Mixing Parameter
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It assumes the brain runs both strategies in parallel. The final value used for decision-making at Stage 1 is a weighted combination of the Model-Free value (TD learning) and the Model-Based value (Planning).

```python
