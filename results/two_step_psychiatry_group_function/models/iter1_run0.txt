Here are three cognitive models proposing different mechanisms for how participants learn in this two-step task.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Learner
This model assumes the participant fully utilizes the transition structure of the task. Instead of learning the value of the first-stage spaceships directly from reward prediction errors (like a model-free learner), it calculates the value of spaceships by combining the known transition probabilities with the learned values of the second-stage aliens.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Learner.
    This model computes Stage 1 values by planning: it combines the known transition 
    matrix with the learned values of Stage 2 states (aliens). It assumes the 
    participant perfectly understands the 70/30 transition structure.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate for updating Stage 2 Q-values based on reward.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    
    # Fixed transition matrix: P(State | Action)
    # Row 0: Action 0 (Spaceship A) -> [0.7 to Planet X, 0.3 to Planet Y]
    # Row 1: Action 1 (Spaceship U) -> [0.3 to Planet X, 0.7 to Planet Y]
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    # Q-values
    # Stage 1 values are calculated on the fly (Model-Based), not stored/updated via TD
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # (State, Action) -> (Planet, Alien)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Decision (Model-Based Planning) ---
        # 1. Determine the best value currently available at each planet (state)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1) # Shape (2,) for Planet X and Y
        
        # 2. Compute expected value of each spaceship using the transition matrix
        # V(Action) = P(State|Action) * V(State)

        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]

        # --- Stage 2 Decision ---
        state_idx = state[trial]
        
        # Standard Softmax for Stage 2
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning ---
        # Only Stage 2 values are updated via prediction error.
        # Stage 1 values are re-computed next trial based on these new Stage 2 values.
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Learner (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This model represents the classic "Two-Step" hypothesis: behavior is a mixture of habitual (Model-Free) and goal-directed (Model-Based) systems. The final valuation of a spaceship is a weighted sum of a TD-learned value and a computed model-based value. This allows the model to capture both sensitivity to transition structure and simple repetition of rewarded actions.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

### Model 3: Model-Free with Choice Perseveration
This model is a variation of the pure Model-Free learner but adds a "perseveration" parameter. Participants often have a tendency to repeat their previous choice regardless of reward (stickiness). This model captures that heuristic, which often explains variance in human data that simple reinforcement learning cannot.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate for updating Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    perseveration: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the log-odds of repeating the previous Stage 1 choice.
