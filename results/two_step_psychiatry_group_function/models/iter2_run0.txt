Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task. These models move beyond the pure Model-Free learner provided in the feedback by introducing Model-Based learning, hybrid strategies, and distinct learning rates for different stages.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Learner
This model assumes the participant fully utilizes the transition structure of the task. Instead of learning Stage 1 values directly from experience (TD-learning), it calculates them by combining the known transition probabilities with the learned values of the second stage. This represents a "planning" strategy.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Learner.
    This model computes Stage 1 values by planning: it combines the known transition matrix
    with the learned Stage 2 values (max Q-value of the next state). It does not maintain
    separate cached Model-Free values for Stage 1.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - The rate at which Stage 2 Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Fixed transition matrix (Common: 0.7, Rare: 0.3)
    # Row 0: Spaceship 0 -> [Planet 0, Planet 1]
    # Row 1: Spaceship 1 -> [Planet 0, Planet 1]
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    # Only Stage 2 values are learned via reward prediction error
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # (State, Action)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate expected value of each spaceship based on transitions and best next-step options
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1) # Max value available at each planet
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2 # Bellman equation for MB

        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mb)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        state_idx = state[trial]
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning ---
        # No Stage 1 update because values are computed on the fly.
        
        # Stage 2 update (Standard Rescorla-Wagner)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It assumes the brain maintains both a Model-Free system (habitual, TD-learning) and a Model-Based system (planning). The final decision at Stage 1 is a weighted combination of both value estimates, controlled by a mixing parameter `w`.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner.
    The agent computes Stage 1 values as a weighted sum of Model-Based values (planning)
    and Model-Free values (cached experience).

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] - Mixing weight. 0 = Pure Model-Free, 1 = Pure Model-Based.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) 
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) 

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice (Hybrid) ---
        # 1. Calculate MB values
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

        # Stage 2 update

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseveration
This model is a variation of the pure Model-Free learner but adds a "perseveration" parameter. This accounts for the common behavioral tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice regardless of reward (motor repetition or "stickiness"), separate from value-based learning.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    perseveration: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
