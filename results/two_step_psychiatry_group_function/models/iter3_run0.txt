Here are three cognitive models exploring different mechanisms of learning and decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This model combines model-free reinforcement learning (TD-learning) with model-based planning. The agent maintains separate value estimates: one derived from direct experience (MF) and another calculated using the known transition structure (MB). The final choice at the first stage is a weighted combination of these two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner combining Model-Based and Model-Free values.
    The agent weighs both systems to make decisions at the first stage.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate for value updates.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] - Weight parameter (0 = pure MF, 1 = pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Fixed transition matrix (70% common, 30% rare)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)  # Model-free Q-values for stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Q-values for stage 2 (aliens)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        # Calculate Model-Based Q-values for Stage 1
        # Q_MB(s1, a1) = sum(P(s2|s1,a1) * max_a2 Q_MF(s2, a2))
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        # Combine MB and MF values
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf

        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]

        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning ---
        # Update Stage 1 MF values (TD(0))
        # Note: In a full hybrid model, Stage 1 MF is often updated by TD error from Stage 2.
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

        # Update Stage 2 values
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Perseveration Learner
This model is a Model-Free learner that includes a "stickiness" or perseveration parameter. This parameter captures the tendency of participants to repeat their previous choice regardless of reward history, a common phenomenon in reinforcement learning tasks.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    perseveration: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the repeated choice (can be negative).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, perseveration = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    last_action_1 = -1  # Initialize with an impossible action

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        # Add perseveration bonus to Q-values before softmax
        q_stage1_effective = q_stage1_mf.copy()

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Separate Learning Rates (Positive/Negative)
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (getting a coin) versus negative outcomes (getting nothing). It uses two separate learning rates for the second stage updates, allowing for asymmetric updating of value expectations.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):

    alpha_neg: [0, 1] - Learning rate for negative prediction errors (at stage 2).
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    """
    alpha_pos, alpha_neg, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    # For stage 1, we use a single learning rate (average of pos/neg or just alpha_pos to keep params low)
    # Here we will use the average for stage 1 to focus the asymmetry on the direct reward learning
    alpha_stage1 = (alpha_pos + alpha_neg) / 2.0

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

        # Apply asymmetric learning rates based on the sign of the error
        # Note: Since reward is 0 or 1 and Q is usually between 0 and 1,
        # delta > 0 usually implies reward=1 (better than expected),
        # delta < 0 usually implies reward=0 (worse than expected).
        if delta_stage2 >= 0:
            q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += alpha_pos * delta_stage2
        else:
