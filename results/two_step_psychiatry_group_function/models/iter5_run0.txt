Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms in the two-step task, specifically focusing on eligibility traces, separate learning rates for different stages, and distinct inverse temperatures for different stages.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: Model-Free Learner with Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda)).
    
    This model assumes the participant is purely Model-Free but uses eligibility traces 
    to update the first-stage values based on the second-stage outcome directly.
    Instead of just Q(s1, a1) <- Q(s2, a2), the reward at the end also updates Q(s1, a1)
    scaled by lambda.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate for value updates.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    lambda_param: [0, 1] - Eligibility trace decay parameter. 
                           0 = TD(0) (standard Q-learning), 1 = Monte Carlo-like updates.
