Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step task paradigm. Each model hypothesizes a different learning strategy:

1.  **Pure Model-Based (MB) Learner:** This model assumes the participant builds a map of the task structure (transition probabilities) and plans their first-stage choices by looking ahead to the expected values of the second stage. It ignores the "cached" value of the first-stage actions.
2.  **Pure Model-Free (MF) Learner (TD-0):** This model assumes the participant learns values based solely on prediction errors experienced at each step. It does not use the transition structure of the task. It updates first-stage values based on the value of the second stage state reached (SARSA-like logic).
3.  **Hybrid Learner (MB + MF):** This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) values to make the first-stage decision.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Learner
This model assumes the participant is a "planner." They learn the values of the aliens (Stage 2) using a simple Rescorla-Wagner rule. However, for Stage 1, they calculate the value of a spaceship by multiplying the known transition probabilities by the max value of the planets.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Learner.
    
    This model assumes the agent learns the values of the second-stage options (aliens)
    via prediction error (Rescorla-Wagner). However, for the first-stage choice (spaceship),
    it calculates values strictly by planning: multiplying the static transition matrix 
    by the best available value at the resulting planets.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Rate at which second-stage values are updated.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))

```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free Learner (TD-0)
This model assumes the participant relies entirely on "cached" values. They do not use the transition structure (70/30 probabilities). If they choose Spaceship A, land on Planet Y (rare), and get a reward, they reinforce Spaceship A directly, ignoring that this was a rare transition.

```python

    of the alien is updated based on the reward (Stage 2 PE).
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Rate at which values are updated.

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner (Mixing parameter)
This model combines Model-Based and Model-Free values for the first-stage decision. A mixing parameter `w` determines the balance. If `w=1`, they are purely model-based; if `w=0`, they are purely model-free.

    sum of both, controlled by parameter `w`.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for MF values.
