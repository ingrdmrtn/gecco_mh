Here are three cognitive models implemented as Python functions. They represent different hypotheses about how participants learn and make decisions in the two-step task: a **Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free** learner, a **Model-Free learner with Eligibility Traces**, and a **Hybrid learner with Choice Stickiness**.
