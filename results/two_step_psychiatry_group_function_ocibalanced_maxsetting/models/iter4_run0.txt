Here are the 3 new cognitive models based on the participant data and the feedback provided.

### Model 1: Outcome-Dependent Stickiness
**Rationale:** Participant 1 shows long streaks of repeating the same spaceship choice (Trials 4-27). Standard stickiness assumes a constant tendency to repeat the previous choice. However, reinforcement learning suggests agents might "stay" more after a win and "shift" (or stay less) after a loss. This model splits the stickiness parameter into `stick_win` (bonus after reward) and `stick_lose` (bonus after no reward), allowing for asymmetric perseverance (e.g., Win-Stay, Lose-Stay).

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Outcome-Dependent Stickiness (Win-Stay/Lose-Stay Asymmetry).
    
    Differentiates the perseverance bonus based on the previous trial's outcome.
    Allows the model to capture if a participant is more likely to repeat a choice
    after a success compared to a failure, independent of value learning.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting between Model-Based (1) and Model-Free (0).
    stick_win: [0, 5] - Stickiness bonus applied to previous choice if it was rewarded.
    stick_lose: [0, 5] - Stickiness bonus applied to previous choice if it was unrewarded.

```

### Model 2: Dual Learning Rates with Stickiness
**Rationale:** The feedback indicated that `lr_1, lr_2` was tried, and `stickiness` was tried separately, but not combined. Given Participant 1's behavior (long streaks implying strong habit/stickiness) and Participant 2's erratic switching, a single learning rate might not capture the difference between learning the transition structure (Stage 1) and the bandit probabilities (Stage 2). This model allows the agent to update Stage 1 and Stage 2 values at different speeds (`lr_stage1`, `lr_stage2`) while maintaining the essential `stickiness` parameter to account for motor perseverance.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Stage-Specific Learning Rates and Stickiness.
    
    Separates the learning plasticity for Stage 1 (transitions/MF value) and 
    Stage 2 (terminal reward) updates. This allows the model to learn 
    immediate reward associations fast (high lr_stage2) while updating 
    stage 1 values slowly (low lr_stage1), or vice versa.
    
    Parameters:
    lr_stage1: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Stage 1 MF values.
    lr_stage2: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Stage 2 values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] - Model-Based weight.
    stickiness: [0, 5] - Choice perseverance bonus.

```

### Model 3: Habit Trace (Perseveration Kernel)
**Rationale:** Simple "stickiness" only considers the immediately preceding trial ($t-1$). However, habits often form over multiple repetitions. This model implements a "Habit Trace" (or perseveration kernel) that accumulates history. If a participant chooses Spaceship A repeatedly, the habit strength for A grows. If they switch, it decays slowly rather than resetting instantly. This differs from the standard Q-learning `stickiness` which is binary (last choice vs others).

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Decaying Habit Trace (Perseveration Kernel).
    
    Instead of binary stickiness (last trial only), this model maintains a 
    continuous 'habit' value for each Stage 1 action. The habit trace 
    accumulates when an action is chosen and decays when it is not, 
    representing longer-term motor perseveration or history-dependent bias.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Q-value update rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] - Model-Based weight.
    habit_decay: [0, 1] - Rate at which the habit trace updates (decays/grows).
    habit_weight: [0, 5] - Influence of the habit trace on choice logits.
