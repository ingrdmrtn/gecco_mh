Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step decision task, designed to explore different cognitive mechanisms such as stage-specific exploration, memory decay, and subjective structure learning.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Dual Inverse Temperatures
This model hypothesizes that participants may exhibit different levels of exploration/exploitation (decision noise) in the high-level planning stage (choosing a spaceship) compared to the low-level bandit stage (choosing an alien).

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Dual Inverse Temperatures.
    
    This model distinguishes between the decision noise in Stage 1 (planning)
    and Stage 2 (harvesting). It uses two separate beta parameters to capture
    potentially different exploration rates for the model-based/hybrid choice
    versus the direct model-free alien choice.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for value learning.
    - beta_stage1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 (Spaceship) choice.
    - beta_stage2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2 (Alien) choice.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter. 1 = Model-Based, 0 = Model-Free.
    """
    learning_rate, beta_stage1, beta_stage2, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model with Passive Decay (Forgetting)
This model introduces a memory decay mechanism. Since the reward probabilities of the aliens change slowly over time, older observations become less relevant. This model relaxes the Q-values of unchosen aliens toward a neutral prior (0.5) on every trial, allowing the participant to "forget" old values and potentially re-explore neglected options.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Passive Decay (Forgetting).
    
    Incorporates a decay parameter that relaxes the value of the unchosen 
    Stage 2 option toward a neutral value (0.5). This accounts for the 
    participant's uncertainty about options they haven't visited recently 
    and the drifting reward probabilities.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for chosen options.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (softness of choice).
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting. 1 = Model-Based, 0 = Model-Free.
    - decay: [0, 1] Rate at which unchosen values relax to 0.5.

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Subjective Transition Belief
Standard models assume the participant knows the transition probabilities are exactly 70% and 30%. This model treats the probability of the "common" transition as a free parameter, allowing for the possibility that participants misestimate the structure (e.g., believing it is more deterministic or more random than it actually is).

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Subjective Transition Belief.
    
    Replaces the fixed 0.7 transition probability with a learnable parameter.
    This captures the participant's subjective belief about the reliability 
    of the spaceship transitions (e.g., believing transitions are 90/10 
    instead of 70/30).

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for MF values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting. 1 = Model-Based, 0 = Model-Free.
