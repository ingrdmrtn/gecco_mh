Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task. These models explore dynamic transition learning, memory decay, and reward-specific perseverance, avoiding the previously tested parameter combinations.

    experience, updating their belief about the structure of the task.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Model-Free action values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (choice consistency).
