    Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (TD(1)).
    
    This model assumes the agent ignores the transition structure (MB) and relies
    solely on direct reinforcement. The first-stage values are updated based on the 
    eventual reward received at the second stage (effectively lambda=1).

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice stochasticity.
