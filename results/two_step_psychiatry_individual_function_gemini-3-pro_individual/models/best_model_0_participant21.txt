    Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Choice Perseveration (Stickiness).
    
    This model is a standard Q-learning model but adds a 'stickiness' parameter.
    This parameter biases the agent to repeat (or avoid) the action taken on the 
    immediately preceding trial, independent of reward history.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - stickiness: Bias added to the previously chosen action (positive = repeat, negative = switch).
    
    Bounds:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1]
    - beta: [0, 10]
    - stickiness: [-5, 5] (Though usually small positive)
