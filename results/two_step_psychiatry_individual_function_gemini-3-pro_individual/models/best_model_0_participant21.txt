    Model-Free Q-Learning with Choice Stickiness.

    This model adds a perseverance (stickiness) bonus to the Q-values of the 
    previously chosen action at the first stage. This accounts for habit-like 
    repetition of choices independent of reward history.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    stickiness: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
