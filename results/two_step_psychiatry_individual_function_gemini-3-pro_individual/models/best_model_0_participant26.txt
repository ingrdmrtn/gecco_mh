    Model-Free TD(Lambda) with Perseveration.
    
    This model relies purely on Model-Free reinforcement learning but uses eligibility 
    traces (lambda) to bridge the two stages. This allows the reward received at Stage 2 
    to directly update the value of the Stage 1 choice. It also includes choice perseveration.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    lambda_eligibility: [0, 1] - Eligibility trace decay (0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo).
    perseveration: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action at Stage 1.
