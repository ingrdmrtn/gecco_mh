    Pure Model-Free TD(1) / Direct Reinforcement Model.
    
    This model updates the first-stage action values directly based on the final reward 
    received, effectively ignoring the intermediate state transition structure. It represents 
    a simple "habitual" learner that repeats actions that led to reward previously.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate at which Q-values are updated. [0, 1]
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice. [0, 10]
