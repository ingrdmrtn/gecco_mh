    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free RL with Perseveration.
    
    This model assumes the agent uses a weighted combination of model-based
    planning (using the transition matrix) and model-free learning (TD learning).
    It also includes a perseveration bonus, where the agent is more likely to 
    repeat their last choice at stage 1.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    perseveration: [0,5] - Bonus added to the previous stage 1 action (stickiness).
