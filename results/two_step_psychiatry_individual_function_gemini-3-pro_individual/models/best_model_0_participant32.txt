    Model-Free Q-Learning with Choice Perseveration.
    
    This model assumes the participant is primarily a model-free learner but is biased 
    towards repeating their previous Stage 1 choice (perseveration).
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values based on prediction error.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choices.
    - perseveration_strength: [-5, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action. 
                                     Positive values encourage repeating choices; negative values encourage switching.
                                     (Note: Bounds are conceptual; in optimization, map appropriately).
