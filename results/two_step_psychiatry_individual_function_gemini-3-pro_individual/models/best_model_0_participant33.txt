    """
    Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseveration ("Stickiness").
    
    Adds a bias to repeat the previous stage 1 action, independent of reward history.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    perseveration: [-5, 5] - Bias to repeat previous choice (positive) or switch (negative).
                             Note: Bounds in optimization should handle this range.
                             If strictly [0,1] is required by system, we can map it, 
                             but usually stickiness can be negative. Assuming [0,1] 
                             maps to a small positive stickiness for this exercise.
