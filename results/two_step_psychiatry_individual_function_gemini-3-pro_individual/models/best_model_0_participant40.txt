    Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseveration.

    This model includes a 'stickiness' or perseveration parameter (p) which 
    biases the first-stage choice towards the action taken on the immediately 
    preceding trial, independent of reward history.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - perseveration: [-5, 5] Bias for repeating the previous choice. 
      (Positive values = stickiness, Negative values = switching).
