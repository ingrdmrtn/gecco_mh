    Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Choice Perseveration (Stickiness).
    
    This model includes a 'stickiness' parameter that biases the agent to repeat 
    (or avoid) the immediately preceding choice at Stage 1, independent of the 
    reward history.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate for updating values [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature [0, 10].
    - eligibility_trace: Strength of TD(1) update for stage 1 [0, 1].
    - stickiness: Bias to repeat the previous stage 1 choice. Positive values mean repetition, 
                  negative mean switching. Range is technically unbounded but typically [-5, 5]. 
                  For these bounds we map [0, 1] to a reasonable range or treat as magnitude.
                  Here we treat it as strictly positive repetition bias [0, 5].
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0, 1]
    beta: [0, 10]
    eligibility_trace: [0, 1]
    stickiness: [0, 5]
