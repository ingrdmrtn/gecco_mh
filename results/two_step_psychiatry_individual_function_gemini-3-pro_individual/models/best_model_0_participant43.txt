    Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning agent (TD-Learning).
    
    This agent learns Stage 1 values by updating them based on the value of the 
    state reached in Stage 2. It ignores transition probabilities (rare vs common).

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Rate at which values are updated.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice stochasticity.
    eligibility_trace: [0,1] - How much the Stage 2 reward directly affects Stage 1 choice (TD(1) vs TD(0)).
