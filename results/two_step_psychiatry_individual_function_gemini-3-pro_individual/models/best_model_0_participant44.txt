    Model-Free Learner with Passive Decay (Forgetting).
    
    Standard Q-learning updates the chosen action. This model adds a decay 
    process where unchosen actions slowly revert to 0 (or lose intensity), 
    mimicking memory trace decay.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate for chosen actions.
    decay_rate: [0,1] Rate at which unchosen action values decay toward 0.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
