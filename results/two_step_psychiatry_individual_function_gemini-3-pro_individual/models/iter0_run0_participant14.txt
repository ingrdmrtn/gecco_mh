Here are three cognitive models based on the provided template and task description.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant builds a mental map of the task structure (transition probabilities) and calculates the value of stage 1 actions by looking ahead to the expected value of stage 2. It does not use a "model-free" cached value for the first stage, relying entirely on the Bellman equation using the transition matrix.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    This model assumes the agent calculates the value of stage 1 actions 
    by combining the known transition matrix with the learned values of 
    the second-stage states. It learns second-stage values via TD learning.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which stage 2 Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice stochasticity.
    """

    # Fixed transition matrix as per task description (A->X common, U->Y common)

        # Calculate expected value of each state (Planet X, Planet Y)
        # The agent assumes they will make the best choice at stage 2.

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free TD(1) Reinforcement Learning
This model ignores the transition structure of the task. It learns the value of stage 1 actions based directly on the reward received at the end of the trial (eligibility trace $\lambda=1$). It does not calculate expected future values but relies on cached history of rewards associated with the spaceships.

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free TD(1) Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    This model ignores the transition structure. It updates the first-stage 
    action values based directly on the final reward received, effectively 
    treating the two stages as a single long action-outcome chain (eligibility trace = 1).

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice stochasticity.

### Model 3: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (Daw et al. 2011 style)
This model combines both strategies. The agent maintains both a model-free Q-value (based on direct reinforcement) and a model-based Q-value (calculated via the transition matrix) for the first stage. A mixing parameter `w` determines the weight given to the model-based system versus the model-free system.

```python

    The agent computes a weighted average of Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF)
    values for the first stage choice. The weight is controlled by parameter w.
    Stage 1 MF values are updated via TD(1) (direct reward reinforcement).

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for Q-value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control (1 = Pure MB, 0 = Pure MF).
