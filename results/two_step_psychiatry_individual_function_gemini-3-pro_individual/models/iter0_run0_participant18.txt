Here are three cognitive models proposing different mechanisms for how the participant makes decisions in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
This is the standard "Daw et al. (2011)" model structure, combining a Model-Free (MF) system that learns from direct experience and a Model-Based (MB) system that uses knowledge of the transition structure. This model assumes the participant weighs these two strategies using a mixing parameter `w`.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Standard Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free RL model.
    
    This model assumes the agent computes Q-values for the first stage using a weighted 
    average of Model-Based (planning using transition matrix) and Model-Free (TD learning) values.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated (alpha).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight. 1 = Pure Model-Based, 0 = Pure Model-Free.
    - lam: [0, 1] Eligibility trace parameter (lambda) connecting stage 2 to stage 1 updates.

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Model-free values for stage 2 (aliens)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        # Model-Based value calculation: V(state) = max_a Q(state, a)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free with Perseveration
This model hypothesizes that the participant does not use the transition structure (Model-Based) at all. Instead, they rely purely on Model-Free reinforcement learning but are heavily influenced by "perseveration"—a tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward. This is often observed in habit-driven behaviors.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Q-learning with Choice Perseveration.

    It adds a 'perseveration' bonus to the previously chosen action at Stage 1,
    capturing stickiness or habit not explained by reward history.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - perseveration: [-5, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive vs Negative Prediction Errors)
This model investigates if the participant learns differently from success versus failure. It splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` (for positive prediction errors) and `alpha_neg` (for negative prediction errors). It assumes a pure Model-Free framework to isolate the effect of asymmetric updating.

    and negative prediction errors (worse than expected). This can capture optimism/pessimism bias.
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors (delta > 0).
    - alpha_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate for negative prediction errors (delta < 0).
