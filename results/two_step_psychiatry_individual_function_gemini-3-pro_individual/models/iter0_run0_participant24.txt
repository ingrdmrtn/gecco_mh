Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step task framework, ranging from simple model-free learning to complex hybrid model-based/model-free strategies.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Free TD Learning (SARSA)
This model assumes the participant learns purely through trial-and-error without building a map of the task structure (i.e., they don't use the transition probabilities). It uses Temporal Difference (TD) learning to update values.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free TD Learning model.
    The participant learns Q-values for both stages purely from experienced rewards
    and prediction errors, ignoring transition probabilities.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Initialize Q-values
    # Stage 1: 2 choices (Spaceships)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) 
    # Stage 2: 2 states (Planets) x 2 choices (Aliens)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) 

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        # Observe state transition
        state_idx = state[trial] # 0 or 1 (Planet X or Y)

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
        
        # --- Learning (TD Updates) ---
        
        # Stage 1 Update: Based on the value of the state we arrived at (TD(0))
        # Note: In standard TD(0) for this task, the reward at stage 1 is 0.
        # The 'value' of the second stage choice is used to update the first stage.
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

        # Stage 2 Update: Based on the actual reward received
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free
This is the classic "Two-Step" model. It assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of Model-Based (planning using the transition matrix) and Model-Free (habitual) values to make the first-stage decision.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free learner.
    Stage 1 choices mix model-based planning (using the transition matrix) 
    and model-free learning.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] - Weight parameter (0 = Pure Model-Free, 1 = Pure Model-Based).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described in task: A->X (0.7), U->Y (0.7)
    # Rows: Spaceships (0, 1), Cols: Planets (0, 1)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        # Calculate Model-Based Value: V_MB(s1) = Transition * max(Q_stage2)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        # Stage 2 is purely model-free (no further transitions to plan)
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Learning ---
        # Stage 1 MF Update (TD-learning)
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # Stage 2 MF Update (Reward learning)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Choice Perseverance
This model extends the Hybrid learner by adding a "perseverance" parameter. Participants often have a tendency to repeat their previous choice regardless of reward (stickiness), which captures motor or cognitive inertia.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):

    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] - Model-based weight.
    perseverance: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
