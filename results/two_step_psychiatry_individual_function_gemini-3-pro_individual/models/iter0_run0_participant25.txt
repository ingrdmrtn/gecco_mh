Here are three cognitive models based on the provided template, ranging from pure model-free learning to a hybrid model-based/model-free approach, and finally a model with separate learning rates for positive and negative outcomes.

### Cognitive Model 1: Pure Model-Free TD Learning (SARSA)
This model assumes the participant does not use knowledge of the transition structure (the spaceships' probabilities). Instead, they learn the value of the first-stage actions solely based on the eventual rewards, chaining values backward using Temporal Difference (TD) errors. This is a classic "habitual" learner.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Learner (SARSA-like).
    This model updates stage 1 values based on the value of the chosen stage 2 state-action pair,
    without using the transition matrix.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    eligibility_trace: [0, 1] - How much the stage 2 reward directly affects stage 1 value (lambda).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, eligibility_trace = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Initialize Q-values
    # q_stage1_mf: Values for the two spaceships (Action 1)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) 
    # q_stage2_mf: Values for the two aliens at each of the two planets (State x Action 2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        # Observe state (planet)
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        # Calculate probabilities for the aliens at the current planet
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
        
        # --- Learning ---
        # Prediction error at stage 1: Difference between Stage 2 Value and Stage 1 Value
        # We use the value of the action actually taken in stage 2 (SARSA style)
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        
        # Update Stage 1 Value
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # Prediction error at stage 2: Difference between Reward and Stage 2 Value
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        
        # Update Stage 2 Value
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # Eligibility trace: Allow the stage 2 RPE to also update stage 1 value directly
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * eligibility_trace * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Cognitive Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This is the standard model for this task (Daw et al., 2011). It assumes the participant computes values in two ways: a "Model-Based" (MB) way that uses the transition matrix to plan, and a "Model-Free" (MF) way that relies on past experience. The final choice is a weighted mix of both.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    with a habitual component.

    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.

        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]

```

### Cognitive Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rate (Pos/Neg) Model
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from success (finding gold) versus failure (finding nothing). It splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`. This is often observed in clinical populations where sensitivity to reward vs. punishment differs. It assumes a simple Model-Free architecture to focus on the learning asymmetry.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    Parameters:

    alpha_neg: [0, 1] - Learning rate when prediction error is negative (worse than expected).
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
