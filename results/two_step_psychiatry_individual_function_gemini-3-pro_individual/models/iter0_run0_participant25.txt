Here are three cognitive models proposed to explain the participant's behavior in the two-step decision-making task.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant builds an internal map of the task structure (Model-Based). They calculate the value of the spaceships (Stage 1) by combining the known transition probabilities with the learned values of the aliens (Stage 2). They do not use a "habitual" (Model-Free) cache for the first stage.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    This model assumes the agent calculates the value of stage 1 actions solely 
    by planning forward using the transition matrix and the learned values of 
    stage 2 states. It does not maintain a separate model-free Q-value for stage 1.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which stage 2 Q-values are updated.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for stage 1 softmax (exploration/exploitation).
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for stage 2 softmax.
    """
    learning_rate, beta_1, beta_2 = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as per task description (A->X/Y, U->Y/X)
    # Rows: Action 1 (0 or 1), Cols: State (0 or 1)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for Stage 2 (aliens): 2 states x 2 actions
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Initialize at 0.5 (neutral expectation)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- STAGE 1 POLICY (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate max value available in each state (0 and 1)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- STAGE 2 POLICY ---
        # Standard Model-Free choice at the second stage

        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (Standard Daw Model)
This is the classic "Hybrid" model often used for this task. It assumes the participant's choice at Stage 1 is a weighted mixture of a habitual system (Model-Free, relying on past rewards of the spaceship) and a planning system (Model-Based, relying on the transition structure).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    Model-Free (MF) values. The weight is controlled by parameter `w`.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for all Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for both stages.

### Model 3: Choice Perseveration Model
This model is a Model-Free learner, but it includes a specific parameter for "perseveration" (or stickiness). This accounts for the tendency of participants to simply repeat their previous motor action (spaceship choice) regardless of the reward outcome, which is a common bias in this task.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Choice Perseveration.
    
    This model relies on habitual learning (Model-Free) but adds a 'stickiness' 
    parameter. If the agent chose 'A' on the last trial, 'A' gets a bonus 
    value on the current trial, regardless of whether it was rewarded.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - perseveration: [-5, 5] Bonus added to the previously chosen action (positive = repeat, negative = switch).
