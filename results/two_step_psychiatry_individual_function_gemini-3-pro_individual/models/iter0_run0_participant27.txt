Here are three cognitive models representing different strategies for the two-step task.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant builds a model of the task structure (transition probabilities) and uses it to plan their first-stage choices. They calculate the expected value of each spaceship by combining the transition matrix with the values of the aliens on each planet.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning.
    
    The agent learns the values of the second-stage options (aliens) via TD learning.
    However, for the first-stage choice (spaceship), it computes values by multiplying 
    the known transition matrix with the maximum values available at the second stage.
    It does not keep a separate Model-Free value for the first stage.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which second-stage Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described in the task (70% common, 30% rare)
    # Row 0: Spaceship A -> [70% Planet X, 30% Planet Y]
    # Row 1: Spaceship U -> [30% Planet X, 70% Planet Y]
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for stage 2 (2 planets x 2 aliens)

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) 

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # Calculate max value available at each planet
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- UPDATING ---
        # Only update Stage 2 values based on reward. 
        # Stage 1 values are re-computed every step from the model.

        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (TD(1))
This model assumes the participant relies entirely on trial-and-error (habitual) learning. Crucially, it uses an eligibility trace (lambda=1 logic) where the reward received at the second stage directly updates the value of the first-stage choice (spaceship) that led to it, ignoring the transition structure.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with direct reward reinforcement.
    
    This agent ignores the transition structure (common/rare). 
    It updates the first-stage choice based on the final reward received, 
    effectively treating the task as a single long chain. This is often 
    referred to as TD(1) or direct reinforcement of the first stage.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - eligibility: [0, 1] How much the stage 1 choice is updated by the stage 2 reward.

### Model 3: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free with Perseveration
This is the classic "Daw 2011" style hybrid model. The agent computes both a model-based value (using the transition matrix) and a model-free value (using temporal difference learning) for the first stage. The final choice is a weighted combination of both. Additionally, a "perseveration" parameter captures the tendency to repeat the previous first-stage choice regardless of reward.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free RL with Perseveration.
    
    The agent uses a weighted mix of Model-Based planning (using transition matrix)
    and Model-Free learning (TD errors) to make decisions. It also includes a 
    stickiness parameter for choice repetition.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter (1 = Pure Model-Based, 0 = Pure Model-Free).
    - perseveration: [0, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
