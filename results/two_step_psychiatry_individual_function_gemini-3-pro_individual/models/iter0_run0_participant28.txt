Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step task paradigm. They progress from a simple model-free learner to a hybrid learner, and finally to a model that incorporates perseveration.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Free Learner (TD Learning)
This model assumes the participant does not build a model of the transition structure (i.e., they don't care that Spaceship A usually goes to Planet X). Instead, they learn the value of the first-stage actions solely based on the eventual reward, using Temporal Difference (TD) learning (specifically SARSA/Q-learning logic).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Learner.
    This model learns the value of stage 1 choices based directly on stage 2 outcomes
    using a Temporal Difference (TD) prediction error, ignoring transition probabilities.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration vs exploitation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Q-values for Stage 1 (2 spaceships)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)  # Initial values usually 0 or 0.5
    # Q-values for Stage 2 (2 planets x 2 aliens)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        # Observe state (planet)
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        # Standard softmax on the Q-values for the current planet
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
        
        # --- Updates ---
        # 1. Update Stage 1 Q-value based on the value of the state reached (TD(0))
        # The value of the state reached is estimated by the Q-value of the chosen action in that state
        prediction_error_1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * prediction_error_1

        # 2. Update Stage 2 Q-value based on the reward received
        prediction_error_2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * prediction_error_2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Learner (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It calculates two values for the first stage: a Model-Based (MB) value (calculated using the known transition matrix and max stage 2 values) and a Model-Free (MF) value (learned via TD). The final choice is a weighted combination of both, controlled by a mixing parameter `w`.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner.

    with a model-free evaluation (TD learning) for the first stage choice.

    Parameters:

    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter (0 = Pure Model-Free, 1 = Pure Model-Based).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix (Space A->Planet X 70%, etc.)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Perseveration
This extends Model 2 by adding a "stickiness" or perseveration parameter (`perseveration`). Humans often repeat their previous first-stage choice regardless of reward (behavioral inertia). This model adds a bias term to the Q-values of the previously chosen action.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] Model-based weight.
