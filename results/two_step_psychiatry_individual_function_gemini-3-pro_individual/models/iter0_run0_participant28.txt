Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step decision-making task. These models explore different balances between Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) reinforcement learning strategies.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Learning (MB)
This model assumes the participant builds an internal model of the task structure (the transition matrix) and plans their first-stage actions based on the expected value of the second stage. It ignores habitual (model-free) learning at the first stage.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    This model assumes the agent calculates Stage 1 values solely by combining 
    the known transition probabilities with the learned values of the Stage 2 states.
    It does not maintain a separate cache of Stage 1 values (no TD(1) or eligibility traces).

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate at which Stage 2 (alien) values are updated. [0, 1]
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation). [0, 10]
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described in task: 
    # Row 0 (Spaceship A) -> 0.7 to Planet X (0), 0.3 to Planet Y (1)
    # Row 1 (Spaceship U) -> 0.3 to Planet X (0), 0.7 to Planet Y (1)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for Stage 2 (2 planets x 2 aliens)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # initialized at 0.0 (or could be 0.5)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- STAGE 1 CHOICE (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate max value available in each state (planet)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial] # Planet arrived at

        # --- STAGE 2 CHOICE ---
        # Standard Q-learning choice for the alien
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
        
        # --- LEARNING ---
        # Only Stage 2 values are learned directly from reward
        # Stage 1 values are derived dynamically next trial via the transition matrix
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free Learning with Eligibility Traces (TD(1))
This model assumes the participant ignores the transition structure entirely. They rely on "caching" values. When they receive a reward at the second stage, they update the value of the alien chosen *and* "backpropagate" that reward to the spaceship chosen in the first stage via an eligibility trace (lambda=1).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Eligibility Traces (TD(1)).
    
    This model ignores the transition probabilities. It learns Stage 1 values 
    directly from the rewards received in Stage 2, essentially treating the 
    sequence as a single chain without structural knowledge.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate at which values are updated. [0, 1]
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice. [0, 10]
    - eligibility_lambda: Strength of updating Stage 1 based on Stage 2 outcome (0=TD(0), 1=Monte Carlo). [0, 1]

        # 1. Update Stage 1 based on Stage 2 value (TD(0) part)

### Model 3: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. The agent maintains both a Model-Based value (calculated via the transition matrix) and a Model-Free value (learned from experience) for the first stage. The final decision value is a weighted combination of both strategies determined by a mixing parameter `w`.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
