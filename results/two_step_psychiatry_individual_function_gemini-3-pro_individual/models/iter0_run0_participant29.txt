Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step decision-making task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This model represents the classic "hybrid" agent often used in two-step task analysis. It assumes the participant uses a mixture of two strategies:
1.  **Model-Free (MF):** Learning values based purely on recent reward history (TD learning).
2.  **Model-Based (MB):** Using knowledge of the transition structure (Spaceship A -> Planet X) to plan future actions.
The parameter `w` controls the balance between these two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning agent.
    
    This agent combines a model-free temporal difference learner with a model-based 
    planner that utilizes the known transition matrix. The parameter `w` dictates 
    the relative weight of model-based vs model-free values in the first-stage decision.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated (alpha).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter (0 = Pure Model-Free, 1 = Pure Model-Based).

    # Row 1 (Spaceship U) -> 30% Planet X (0), 70% Planet Y (1)

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values initialized to 0 (or 0.5 for neutral expectation)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # MF values for Stage 1 (Spaceships)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # MF values for Stage 2 (Aliens at Planets)

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free Learner with Eligibility Traces (TD(1))
This model assumes the participant does *not* use the transition structure (transition matrix) at all. Instead, it relies on "eligibility traces" (lambda). When a reward is received at the second stage, it reinforces not just the second-stage choice (Alien), but also "traces back" to reinforce the first-stage choice (Spaceship) directly. This is effectively a TD(1) or direct reinforcement learner.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free TD(lambda) learner.
    
    This agent does not use the transition matrix. Instead, it uses an eligibility 
    trace parameter (lambda_trace) to pass the reward prediction error from the 
    second stage directly back to update the first stage Q-values.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate (alpha).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - lambda_trace: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay.

```

### Model 3: Model-Based with Choice Perseveration
This model is primarily a Model-Based learner (calculating values based on the transition matrix), but it includes a "perseveration" parameter. This parameter captures the human tendency to simply repeat the last motor action (choosing the same spaceship) regardless of reward or model structure. This is often a significant noise factor in behavioral data.

    """

    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate for updating Stage 2 values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - perseveration: [0, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
