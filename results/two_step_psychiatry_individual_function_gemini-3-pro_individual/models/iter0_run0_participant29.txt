Here are three cognitive models analyzing the participant's behavior in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This is the standard "Daw two-step" model, which assumes the participant uses a mixture of Model-Based (planning using the transition matrix) and Model-Free (habitual, TD-learning) strategies. A mixing parameter `w` determines the balance between these two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid reinforcement learning model combining Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) strategies.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate (alpha): [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration vs exploitation).

    # Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)       # Model-free values for stage 1 (Spaceships)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Model-free values for stage 2 (Aliens per Planet)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Decision ---
        # Model-Based Calculation: Plan using transition matrix and max stage 2 values
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        # driven by the value of the state reached.

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free with Eligibility Traces (TD-Lambda)
This model assumes the participant does not use the transition structure (transition matrix) at all. Instead, they rely purely on temporal difference learning. It introduces an eligibility trace parameter `lambda`. If `lambda` is 1, the reward fully reinforces the first-stage choice. If `lambda` is 0, the first-stage choice is only reinforced by the value of the second-stage state reached, not the final reward directly.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Choice Perseveration Model
This model extends a basic reinforcement learner by adding a "perseveration" parameter. This captures the tendency to repeat the same Step 1 action (Spaceship choice) regardless of reward history, a common bias in behavioral data. It assumes a basic Model-Free learning mechanism but modifies the policy calculation.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    perseveration: [-5, 5] Bias to repeat previous stage 1 choice (>0 sticky, <0 switchy).
                        (Note: Bounds in optimizer might need to be adjusted, but [0,1] is usually fine for magnitude)
                        Here we treat it as an additive bonus to the Q-value.
