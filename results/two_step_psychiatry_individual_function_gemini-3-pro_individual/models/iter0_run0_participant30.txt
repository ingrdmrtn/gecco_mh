Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step decision-making task.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant builds a mental map of the task structure (transition probabilities) and plans their first-stage actions based on the expected value of the second stage. It ignores the direct "model-free" history of the first-stage actions and focuses entirely on the calculated value of the planets.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based RL.
    
    This model assumes the agent calculates the value of stage 1 actions solely 
    by combining the known transition matrix with the learned values of the 
    stage 2 states (planets). It does not maintain a separate cached value 
    for stage 1 actions (no model-free component at stage 1).

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Rate at which stage 2 Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described in the task (0.7 common, 0.3 rare)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # We only track Q-values for the second stage (2 planets x 2 aliens)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # initialized at 0.5 or 0 usually, here 0

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- STEP 1: CHOICE ---
        # Calculate Model-Based values for Stage 1
        # Value of a spaceship = sum(prob(planet|spaceship) * max_value(planet))
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Softmax policy for stage 1

        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial] # The planet actually reached

        # --- STEP 2: CHOICE ---
        # Standard Q-learning choice for the alien
        q_values_current_state = q_stage2_mf[state_idx]
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_values_current_state)
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- UPDATING ---
        # No Stage 1 update needed because q_stage1_mb is re-calculated every trial
        # from q_stage2_mf.
        
        # Update Stage 2 Q-values based on reward
        # Prediction Error: Reward - Current Expectation
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free RL with Mixing Parameter
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It assumes the participant's first-stage choice is a weighted combination of a Model-Based system (planning using the transition matrix) and a Model-Free system (simple TD learning from previous trials). A mixing parameter `w` controls the balance between these two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF RL.
    
    This model combines Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (caching) values.
    A parameter 'w' determines the relative weight of the Model-Based system.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0,1] - Weight of Model-Based control (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)       # Model-free values for spaceships
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Model-free values for aliens
    
    # Eligibility trace is implicitly 0 (SARSA(0)) or 1 (SARSA(1)).

### Model 3: Pure Model-Free RL with Choice Perseverance
This model assumes the participant ignores the transition structure entirely (Pure Model-Free). However, it adds a "perseverance" parameter. Humans often have a tendency to simply repeat their last motor action (or switch from it) regardless of reward history. This model captures that "stickiness" or habit.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free RL with Choice Perseverance.

    to the previously chosen action at stage 1.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    perseverance: [0,5] - Bonus added to the logits of the previously chosen action.
