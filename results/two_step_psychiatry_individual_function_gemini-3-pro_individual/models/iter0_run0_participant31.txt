Here are three distinct cognitive models based on the two-step task paradigm. They explore different balances of model-based vs. model-free control, varying learning rates, and perseverance.

### Model 1: Classic Hybrid Model (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This model implements the standard interpretation of the two-step task. It assumes the participant uses a mixture of Model-Based (planning using the transition matrix) and Model-Free (learning from direct experience) strategies for the first-stage choice. It uses a single learning rate for simplicity.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Classic Hybrid Model: Combines Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) learning.
    
    The first-stage Q-value is a weighted sum of MB and MF values.
    MB values are calculated using the known transition matrix and max 2nd-stage values.
    MF values are updated via TD-learning.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated based on prediction errors.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation balance).
    w: [0, 1] Weight parameter. 1 = Pure Model-Based, 0 = Pure Model-Free.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described in the task (70% common, 30% rare)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values initialization
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)       # Model-free values for stage 1 spaceships (0 or 1)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Model-free values for stage 2 aliens (Planet x Alien)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # 1. Calculate Model-Based values: Transition * max(Stage 2 values)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---
        # Standard softmax on the specific aliens available at the current planet

        # --- Learning / Updating ---
        # 1. Update Stage 1 MF value (TD(0) style, though often formulated as eligibility traces in full models)
        # Here we update based on the value of the state we actually landed in.
        # Note: In simple hybrid models, q_stage1_mf often updates towards q_stage2_mf[state, choice].
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free with Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda))
This model assumes the participant does *not* use the transition structure (Planet probabilities) explicitly. Instead, they rely entirely on temporal difference learning. Crucially, it includes an eligibility trace parameter (`lambda`), which allows the reward at the second stage to directly reinforce the first-stage choice, bridging the gap between the spaceship choice and the coin receipt.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free TD(lambda): No model-based planning.
    Uses eligibility traces to credit the first-stage choice with the second-stage reward.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Step size for value updates.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    lam: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay (lambda). Controls how much the stage 2 reward updates stage 1 Q-values directly.

    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Choice Stickiness (Perseverance)
This extends the classic hybrid model by adding a "perseverance" or "stickiness" parameter. Participants often repeat their previous choice regardless of reward (motor perseverance) or switch less often than optimal. This model captures that tendency in the first stage.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    Combines Model-Based and Model-Free learning, but adds a 'stickiness' bonus 
    to the option chosen on the previous trial.

    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] Weight mixing MB (1) and MF (0).
    perseverance: [0, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen spaceship.
