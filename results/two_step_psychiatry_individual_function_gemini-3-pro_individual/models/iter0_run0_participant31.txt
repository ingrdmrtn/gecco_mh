Here are three cognitive models proposed as Python functions. They represent different strategies for solving the two-step task: a pure Model-Based learner, a pure Model-Free learner, and a Hybrid learner that combines both strategies.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Learner
This model assumes the participant builds a mental map of the transition structure (which spaceship leads to which planet) and plans their first-stage choice based on the values learned at the second stage. It ignores the direct reinforcement of the first-stage choice (Model-Free Stage 1 values) and relies entirely on the computed values from the transition matrix and second-stage Q-values.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Learner.
    
    This model assumes the agent uses a fixed transition matrix to calculate
    expected values for the first stage based on the learned values of the second stage.
    It does not maintain separate model-free Q-values for the first stage.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Rate at which second-stage Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature parameter for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described in the task (70% common, 30% rare)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for Stage 2 (2 states x 2 actions)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Initialized to 0.5 (neutral) or 0

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- POLICY FOR FIRST CHOICE (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate the max value available at each state in stage 2
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        
        # Bellman equation: Q_MB(s1, a1) = Sum(P(s2|s1,a1) * max(Q(s2, a2)))
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mb)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- POLICY FOR SECOND CHOICE ---
        # Standard softmax on the specific state's Q-values
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- ACTION VALUE UPDATING ---
        
        # No Stage 1 Model-Free update in this pure MB model.
        
        # Update Stage 2 Q-values based on reward prediction error
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free Learner (TD-Learning)
This model ignores the transition structure entirely. It treats the task as a simple chain of actions. It learns the value of the first-stage choice based on the value of the state arrived at (SARSA-style or Q-learning style updates). It is sensitive to "rare" transitions in a way that is often suboptimal (e.g., repeating a choice that led to a rare transition and a reward, even if that transition is unlikely to happen again).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Learner (TD-Learning).
    
    This model relies solely on Temporal Difference learning. The value of the first
    stage choice is updated based on the value of the second stage state/action.
    It does not use the transition matrix.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    eligibility_trace: [0,1] Determines how much the stage 1 choice is updated by the final reward (lambda).

    learning_rate, beta, eligibility_trace = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

### Model 3: Hybrid Model (MB + MF) with Mixing Weight
This is the classic "Two-Step" model often used in literature (e.g., Daw et al., 2011). It assumes the agent computes both a Model-Based value (using the transition matrix) and a Model-Free value (from direct experience) for the first stage, and combines them using a weighting parameter `w`.
