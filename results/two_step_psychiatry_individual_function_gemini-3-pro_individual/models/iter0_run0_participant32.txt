Here are three cognitive models representing different strategies for the two-step decision task.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant builds an internal model of the task structure (the transition probabilities) and uses it to plan their first-stage choices. They calculate the expected value of each spaceship based on the values of the planets they lead to. It ignores the direct reinforcement history of the spaceships (Model-Free Stage 1 values) and relies entirely on the calculated Model-Based values.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning.
    
    This model assumes the agent exclusively uses the transition structure of the task 
    to calculate the value of stage 1 actions (spaceships) based on the current values 
    of stage 2 states (planets). It does not maintain a separate model-free value for stage 1.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which stage 2 (planet-alien) values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Transition matrix: A -> X (0.7), U -> Y (0.7) usually.
    # Rows: Actions (Spaceships), Cols: States (Planets)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for Stage 2: 2 states (planets) x 2 actions (aliens)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Policy for the first choice (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate the max value available at each planet
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

        # --- Policy for the second choice ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Updates ---
        # No Stage 1 update needed as this is pure MB using static transitions
        
        # Stage 2 (Planet-Alien) Update
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (TD(1))
This model assumes the participant ignores the transition structure (common vs. rare transitions) completely. They learn the value of spaceships based simply on whether a choice was eventually rewarded or not. This is a "direct reinforcement" approach where the reward at the end of the trial reinforces both the alien chosen *and* the spaceship chosen previously.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (TD(1)-like).
    
    This model ignores the transition probabilities. It updates the value of the 
    first-stage action (spaceship) directly based on the final reward received, 
    bypassing the intermediate state value. This represents a simple habit-based learner.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - eligibility: [0, 1] How much credit the first stage action gets for the final reward (lambda).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, eligibility = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for Stage 1 (Spaceships) and Stage 2 (Planet-Aliens)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) 
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

        # Update Stage 2 value
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # Update Stage 1 value directly from Stage 2 prediction error (eligibility trace)
        # This effectively reinforces Action 1 based on the final reward outcome
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * eligibility * delta_stage2

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" two-step model. It assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of both strategies. They maintain a Model-Free value (based on direct reinforcement) and calculate a Model-Based value (based on planning). A weighting parameter (`w`) determines which system dominates the decision.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner.
    
    The agent calculates both a Model-Based value (using the transition matrix) and a 
    Model-Free value (using TD errors) for the first stage. The final Q-value used for 
    decision making is a weighted sum of these two components.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
