Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step decision-making task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It assumes the participant uses a mixture of two strategies:
1.  **Model-Free (MF):** Learning directly from reward prediction errors (TD learning).
2.  **Model-Based (MB):** Using knowledge of the transition structure (Spaceship A -> Planet X, U -> Planet Y) to plan future actions.
A weighting parameter `w` controls the balance between these two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    This model assumes behavior is a mix of a model-free system (TD learning)
    and a model-based system (planning using the transition matrix).
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = pure Model-Free, 1 = pure Model-Based).

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Model-free values for Stage 2 (Aliens on Planets)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- STAGE 1 CHOICE ---
        # Model-Based value calculation: V(state) = max(Q_stage2)

        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free TD(1)
This model assumes the participant does *not* use the transition structure (no model-based planning). Instead, it relies purely on temporal difference learning. Crucially, it includes an eligibility trace parameter `lambda_eligibility`. This parameter allows the reward received at the very end (Stage 2) to directly update the value of the Stage 1 choice (Spaceship), bridging the gap between the first action and the final outcome.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free TD(lambda) Learning.

    It uses an eligibility trace (lambda) to allow the second-stage reward 
    to reinforce the first-stage choice directly.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    lambda_eligibility: [0, 1] - Eligibility trace decay (0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo).

### Model 3: Choice Perseveration + Model-Free Learning
This model hypothesizes that the participant is primarily a model-free learner but exhibits "choice stickiness" or perseveration. Regardless of reward, they have a tendency to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice. This is captured by a `perseveration` parameter. This is a common heuristic in bandit tasks and two-step tasks that can account for variance not explained by reward learning.

    """

    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
