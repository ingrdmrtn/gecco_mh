Here are three cognitive models representing different strategies for the two-step task.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant builds a mental map of the task structure. They learn the values of the second-stage aliens (Model-Free learning at stage 2) but make their first-stage spaceship choice by calculating expected values based on the known transition probabilities (70/30) rather than simple trial-and-error.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    This model assumes the agent uses the known transition matrix to calculate 
    stage 1 values based on stage 2 values (Model-Based), rather than learning 
    stage 1 values directly from experience. Stage 2 values are learned via 
    standard Rescorla-Wagner (Model-Free).

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate at which stage 2 Q-values are updated [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice [0, 10].

    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Known transition matrix:

    # Row 1 (Spaceship U/1) -> 0.3 to Planet X/0, 0.7 to Planet Y/1

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant relies entirely on trial-and-error (habitual) learning. They update the value of the chosen spaceship based on the value of the planet they arrived at (TD-learning), and update the alien values based on rewards. They ignore the transition probabilities structure.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Model (TD(0)).
    
    This model assumes the agent learns stage 1 values purely from experienced 
    rewards and transitions, ignoring the transition probability matrix. 
    It chains values using temporal difference learning.

    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice [0, 10].

### Model 3: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free with Mixing Parameter
This is the classic "Daw" model. It assumes the participant's brain computes both a Model-Based value (using the map) and a Model-Free value (using trial history) for the spaceships. The final decision is a weighted combination of these two systems, controlled by a mixing weight `w`.
