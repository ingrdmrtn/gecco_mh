Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step decision-making task.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant builds a mental map of the task structure (transition probabilities) and calculates the value of stage 1 choices by looking ahead to stage 2. It ignores the "Model-Free" habit learning at stage 1 entirely, relying solely on planning.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based learner.
    Calculates stage 1 values by multiplying the known transition matrix by the 
    learned stage 2 values. Does not use a stage 1 Temporal Difference error.
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - How quickly stage 2 values update.
    beta_1: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for stage 1 choice.
    beta_2: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for stage 2 choice.
    """
    learning_rate, beta_1, beta_2 = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix: 
    # Row 0: Spaceship A (0) -> [70% Planet X (0), 30% Planet Y (1)]
    # Row 1: Spaceship U (1) -> [30% Planet X (0), 70% Planet Y (1)]
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for Stage 2 (2 states x 2 actions)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Initialized at 0 (or 0.5)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate expected value of each spaceship based on max value of planets
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta_1 * q_stage1_mb)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial] # The planet we actually arrived at

        # --- Stage 2 Policy (Simple Q-learning) ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta_2 * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Updates ---
        # Note: In a pure MB model, we don't update a Stage 1 Q-table (q_stage1_mf).
        # We only update the Stage 2 values based on reward.
        
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Learner (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of Model-Free learning (choosing what was rewarded previously) and Model-Based learning (planning based on transition probabilities) for the first stage decision.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    (Planning) for the first stage choice using a weighting parameter 'w'.
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature (shared for both stages).
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # 1. Model-Based Value
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # Note: In some versions, an eligibility trace allows the reward to update Stage 1 directly (TD(1)),
        # but this implementation uses simple TD(0) for Stage 1 MF.

### Model 3: Choice Perseveration (Model-Free with Stickiness)
This model assumes the participant is purely Model-Free (habit-based) but has a tendency to repeat their previous choice regardless of reward (perseveration or "stickiness"). This captures simple motor repetition or cognitive inertia often seen in these tasks.

```python

    """
    Model-Free learner with Choice Perseveration.

    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    stickiness: [0,5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
