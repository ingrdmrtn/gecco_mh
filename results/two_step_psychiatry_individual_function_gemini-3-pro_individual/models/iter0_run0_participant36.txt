Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step task paradigm. Each model hypothesizes a different balance of learning strategies (Model-Free vs. Model-Based) and parameterizations.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based (MB) Learner
This model assumes the participant builds a mental map of the transition structure (which spaceship goes to which planet) and plans their first-stage choices based on the expected value of the second stage. It ignores direct reinforcement of the first-stage action (Model-Free learning) and relies entirely on the calculated values from the second stage.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based (MB) Learner.
    
    This model assumes the agent calculates the value of stage 1 actions solely 
    by combining the known transition matrix with the learned values of stage 2 states.
    It does not maintain a separate Model-Free Q-value for stage 1.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Rate at which stage 2 Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described in task (A->X 70%, U->Y 70%)
    # Rows: Action 1 (0 or 1), Cols: State (0 or 1)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for Stage 2: 2 states (planets) x 2 actions (aliens)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Initialize at 0 (or 0.5)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- STAGE 1 CHOICE (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate max value available in each state (planet)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        
        # Bellman equation: Q_MB(a1) = sum(P(s|a1) * max(Q(s, a2)))

        # --- STAGE 2 CHOICE ---
        # Standard Q-learning choice based on stage 2 values
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- UPDATES ---
        # No Stage 1 MF update because this is a pure MB model.
        
        # Stage 2 Update (Standard Q-learning)
        # RPE = Reward - Expectation
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This is the classic "Two-Step" model. It assumes the participant uses a mixture of Model-Based planning (using the transition matrix) and Model-Free learning (reinforcing the first choice based on the eventual reward, regardless of the transition). A mixing parameter `w` determines the balance between these two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner.

    (planning) and Model-Free values (habit).

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for both stage 1 and stage 2 Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0,1] - Mixing weight. 1 = Pure Model-Based, 0 = Pure Model-Free.

    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # MF values for Stage 1 (2 actions)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    # MF values for Stage 2 (2 states x 2 actions)

### Model 3: Pure Model-Free with Choice Perseveration
This model assumes the participant ignores the transition structure entirely (Pure Model-Free) but has a tendency to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of reward. This "perseveration" bias is common in human and animal data.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseveration.
    
    This model relies only on direct reinforcement history. It adds a 
    'perseveration' parameter to capture the tendency to repeat the last choice 
    made at stage 1 ("stickiness").

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    perseveration: [0,5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
