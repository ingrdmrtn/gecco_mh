Here are three cognitive models based on the provided template, varying in how they balance model-based and model-free reinforcement learning mechanisms.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Free Learner (TD(1))
This model assumes the participant ignores the transition structure (the probability of reaching a planet given a spaceship) and learns strictly from experienced rewards. It updates the first-stage values based directly on the final reward received (TD(1) logic), ignoring the intermediate state value. This represents a simple "habitual" learner.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Learner (TD(1)).
    This model learns values for stage 1 and stage 2 purely based on received rewards,
    ignoring the transition probabilities (model structure). It updates stage 1
    values directly from the final outcome.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Initialize Q-values
    q_stage1 = np.zeros(2)      # Values for Spaceship 0 and 1
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Values for (Planet 0, Planet 1) x (Alien 0, Alien 1)
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---

        delta_stage2 = r - q_stage2[state_idx, a2]

        # Update Stage 1 value (Spaceship) directly from Reward (TD(1)-like)
        # In a pure MF TD(1) view, we credit the first choice with the final reward
        # Q1(a1) = Q1(a1) + alpha * (r - Q1(a1))

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Based Learner
This model assumes the participant calculates the value of the first-stage actions strictly by combining the known transition matrix (70/30) with the learned values of the second stage. It does not maintain a separate model-free value for the first stage. This represents a "goal-directed" learner who always plans ahead.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    Stage 2 values through the transition matrix. It does not learn separate 
    Stage 1 Q-values via prediction error.

### Model 3: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It maintains both a model-free Q-value (learned from experience) and a model-based Q-value (calculated via planning) for the first stage. A mixing parameter `w` determines the weight given to the model-based system. If `w=1`, it is purely model-based; if `w=0`, it is purely model-free.
