Here are three cognitive models based on the provided template and task description.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant builds a model of the task structure (transition probabilities) and plans their first-stage actions based on the expected value of the second stage. It does not use Model-Free (direct reinforcement) learning for the first stage.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning.
    
    This model assumes the participant calculates the value of first-stage actions 
    solely by combining the known transition matrix with the learned values of the 
    second-stage options (aliens). It ignores direct reinforcement of first-stage choices.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which second-stage Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration vs. exploitation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described: A(0)->X(0) (0.7), U(1)->Y(1) (0.7)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for the second stage (aliens): 2 planets x 2 aliens
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) 

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Policy (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate max value available in each state (planet)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        
        # Calculate Model-Based Q-values for stage 1: T * V(State)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Softmax for Stage 1
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mb)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial] # Actual planet arrived at

        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---
        # Standard softmax on the alien values for the current planet
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Updates ---
        # No Stage 1 update needed for Pure MB (values are derived, not stored)
        
        # Stage 2 Update (TD Learning)
        # Update the specific alien chosen on the specific planet
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (TD(1))
This model assumes the participant ignores the transition structure entirely. They learn the value of the first-stage spaceships based directly on the rewards received at the very end of the trial (ignoring the intermediate state transition). This is often implemented as TD(1) or direct reinforcement.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (TD(1) / Direct Reinforcement).
    
    This model assumes the participant learns the value of spaceships based directly
    on the final reward, ignoring the transition structure (planets). It updates
    Stage 1 values using the final reward outcome.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - eligibility_trace: [0, 1] How much credit the first action gets for the final reward (lambda).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, eligibility_trace = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for Stage 1 (spaceships) and Stage 2 (aliens)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Policy (Model-Free) ---

        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Updates ---
        
        # Stage 2 Prediction Error
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        
        # Update Stage 2 Q-values
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # Update Stage 1 Q-values using eligibility trace (TD(1)-like logic)
        # The Stage 1 value is updated by the final prediction error scaled by lambda
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * eligibility_trace * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Hybrid Model (MB/MF Mixture)
This is the classic "Daw two-step" model. It assumes the participant's first-stage choice is a weighted combination of Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) values. A mixing parameter `w` determines the balance between these two systems.

```python
