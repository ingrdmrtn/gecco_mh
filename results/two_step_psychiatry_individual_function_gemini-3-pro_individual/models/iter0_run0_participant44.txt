Here are three cognitive models modeling the participant's decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (TD-0)
This model ignores the transition structure of the task (the relationship between spaceships and planets). It learns the value of the first-stage actions (spaceships) based solely on the reward received at the end of the trial, "caching" values directly. It assumes the participant treats the task as a simple chain of associations without a cognitive map.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (TD-0).
    
    This model assumes the participant learns the value of actions solely based on 
    prediction errors, ignoring the transition structure (model-based information).
    It updates stage 1 values based on the value of the chosen stage 2 state,
    and stage 2 values based on the received reward.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Rate at which value estimates are updated (alpha).
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule (exploration/exploitation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Initialize Q-values
    # q_stage1_mf: Values for Spaceships A (0) and U (1)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) 
    # q_stage2_mf: Values for Aliens on Planet X (row 0) and Planet Y (row 1)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) 

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # Calculate probabilities using Softmax on Model-Free values
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]

        a2 = action_2[trial]
        r = reward[trial]

        # --- Value Updating (TD-0) ---
        
        # Prediction Error 1: Difference between Stage 2 value and Stage 1 expectation
        # Note: In SARSA/TD(0), we use the value of the *chosen* next state action
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] - q_stage1_mf[a1]

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant relies entirely on a cognitive map of the task. Instead of learning Stage 1 values from experience directly, it calculates them on the fly by combining the known transition probabilities (70/30) with the currently estimated values of the second-stage states (aliens). It plans forward at decision time.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning.
    
    This model computes the value of Stage 1 actions by planning forward.
    It combines the fixed transition matrix with the learned values of Stage 2 actions.
    It does not maintain a separate cached value for Stage 1 actions (no MF update for Stage 1).

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Rate at which stage 2 (alien) values are updated.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.

### Model 3: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (Standard Daw Model)
This is the canonical model for this task. It assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of both strategies. They maintain cached habits (Model-Free) and a planning system (Model-Based). A mixing parameter `w` determines which system controls the Stage 1 decision.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):

    and Model-Free (MF) valuations.

    MF values are derived from TD errors (SARSA/TD(1) logic).

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for value learning.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
