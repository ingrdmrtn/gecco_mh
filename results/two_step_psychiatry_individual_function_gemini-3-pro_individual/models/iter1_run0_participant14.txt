Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step decision-making task, exploring different mechanisms like model-based planning, perseverance, and hybrid learning.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Learning
This model assumes the participant uses a mental map of the task structure (Model-Based) to make decisions, rather than just learning from direct experience (Model-Free). It calculates the value of first-stage actions by projecting forward to the best possible second-stage values, weighted by the known transition probabilities.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    This model assumes the agent calculates the value of Stage 1 actions by 
    planning forward. It uses the known transition matrix and the learned 
    values of the second-stage states (aliens) to compute expected value.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which second-stage Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Transition matrix: row 0 is spaceship A, row 1 is spaceship U
    # Planet X is index 0, Planet Y is index 1.
    # Spaceship A (0) -> Planet X (0) is common (0.7)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Values for Aliens on Planet X (0) and Y (1)
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Decision (Model-Based) ---
        # The agent plans: "If I choose spaceship A, where do I go and what can I get?"
        # Value of a state (Planet) is the max value of the aliens there
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        
        # MB value is weighted sum of next-state values
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mb)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]

        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Stage 2 Decision ---
        # Standard softmax on the alien values for the current planet
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Updates ---
        # In a pure MB model, we only update the terminal values (Stage 2)
        # The Stage 1 values are re-computed on the fly next trial.
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learning
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It posits that the brain uses a mixture of both Model-Free (habitual) and Model-Based (goal-directed) systems. A mixing parameter `w` determines the balance between these two systems during the first-stage choice.

```python

    on the first-stage choice.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.

    n_trials = len(action_1)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # MF values for Stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # MF values for Stage 2 (also used by MB)

### Model 3: Model-Free with Choice Perseverance
This model extends the basic Model-Free learning with a "perseverance" (or "stickiness") parameter. This captures the common behavioral tendency to repeat the previous action regardless of reward, which is distinct from reinforcement learning.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):

    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    perseverance: [0, 5] Bonus added to the log-odds of repeating the previous Stage 1 choice.
