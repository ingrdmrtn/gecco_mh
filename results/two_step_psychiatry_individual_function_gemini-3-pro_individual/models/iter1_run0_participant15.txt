Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task framework. These models introduce different mechanisms for how the participant might be integrating model-free and model-based information, or handling perseverance.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free with Mixing Parameter
This model assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) strategies for the first-stage choice. This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" hybrid model structure, simplified to fit within the parameter constraints.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    This model combines Model-Based (MB) values, derived from the transition matrix,
    with Model-Free (MF) values learned from direct experience at the first stage.
    A mixing parameter `w` determines the balance between these two systems.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate for updating Q-values (both stages).
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)       # Model-free values for stage 1 (spaceships)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Model-free values for stage 2 (aliens)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Policy for the first choice ---
        # 1. Calculate Model-Based values
        # Max Q-value at stage 2 for each state (planet)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # 2. Combine MB and MF values using weight w
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf

        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Updating ---
        # Update Stage 1 MF value (TD(0))
        # Note: In full SARSA(lambda) models, this might include an eligibility trace, 
        # but here we use simple TD updates for the template structure.

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free with Choice Perseverance
This model ignores the transition structure (Pure Model-Free) but includes a "perseverance" parameter. This captures the tendency to repeat the previous action regardless of reward (habitual repetition), which is often a strong signal in human behavioral data.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Model with Choice Perseverance.
    
    This model relies solely on temporal difference learning (TD) without knowledge
    of the transition matrix. It adds a perseverance bonus to the previously 
    chosen action at Stage 1, capturing a tendency to repeat choices.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate for updating Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    perseverance: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action (Stickiness).

    learning_rate, beta, perseverance = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # transition_matrix is unused in pure MF, but kept for structure consistency

### Model 3: Model-Based with Forgetting (Decay)
This model assumes the participant is Model-Based (planning using the transition matrix), but their memory of the second-stage values decays over time toward a neutral value. This captures the cognitive limitation where values of unvisited states become less certain or revert to a baseline.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Based Model with Value Decay.
    
    This model uses the transition matrix to plan (Model-Based). However, 
    unchosen options at the second stage decay towards 0 (neutral) on every trial.
    This simulates memory loss or passive forgetting of reward probabilities.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate for updating Q-values from reward.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    decay_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values decay toward 0 on every trial.
