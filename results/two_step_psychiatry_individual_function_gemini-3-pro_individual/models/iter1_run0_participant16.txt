Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task paradigm, exploring different mechanisms like perseveration, model-free learning, and hybrid strategies.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Free Learning with Eligibility Traces (TD(1))
This model assumes the participant relies entirely on past rewards to value the first-stage spaceships, ignoring the transition structure (the "model" of which spaceship goes to which planet). It uses an eligibility trace (lambda=1) to update the first-stage choice based on the final reward, linking the spaceship directly to the coin received.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (TD(1)).
    
    This model assumes the agent ignores the transition structure (MB) and relies
    solely on direct reinforcement. The first-stage values are updated based on the 
    eventual reward received at the second stage (effectively lambda=1).

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice stochasticity.
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Initialize Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)       # Values for Spaceships A and B
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Values for Aliens on Planet X and Y

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Choice (Spaceship) ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial] # Actual planet arrived at

        # --- Stage 2 Choice (Alien) ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Updates ---
        # Update Stage 2 Q-values (Standard Rescorla-Wagner)
        # Prediction error at second stage
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # Update Stage 1 Q-values (Model-Free TD(1))
        # In TD(1), the first stage is updated by the final reward directly.
        delta_stage1 = reward[trial] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free with Mixing Parameter
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style hybrid model. It assumes the agent computes both a Model-Based value (using the transition matrix) and a Model-Free value (using direct experience) for the first stage choices, and combines them using a weighting parameter `w`.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Model.
    
    The agent calculates Stage 1 values as a weighted sum of Model-Based (MB) 
    planning and Model-Free (MF) experience.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # Model-free values for stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Values for stage 2 (used by both systems)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        # 1. Calculate Model-Based values
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        # Update Stage 1 MF values (using TD(1) / direct reinforcement from reward)
        # Note: Often TD(0) is used, but TD(1) is a common simplification for this task structure
        delta_stage1 = reward[trial] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Model-Based Learning with Choice Perseveration
This model is primarily Model-Based (planning based on transitions), but it adds a "stickiness" or perseveration parameter. This captures the tendency of participants to simply repeat their last Stage 1 action regardless of reward or model structure.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    Stage 1 choice.

    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
