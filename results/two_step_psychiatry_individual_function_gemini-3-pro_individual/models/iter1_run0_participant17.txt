Here are three new cognitive models based on the provided template and participant data. These models explore different balances of model-free and model-based reinforcement learning mechanisms.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This model implements the classic "hybrid" architecture often used in two-step tasks. It assumes the participant's first-stage choice is a weighted mixture of a Model-Based value (planning through the transition matrix) and a Model-Free value (learning directly from experience).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Model.

    This model posits that the agent combines two systems for the first-stage choice:
    1. A Model-Based (MB) system that computes values using the transition matrix and stage 2 values.
    2. A Model-Free (MF) system that learns stage 1 values via TD-error (SARSA-like).
    A weighting parameter `w` determines the balance between these systems.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated (for both stages).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as per task structure (70% common, 30% rare)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values initialization
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)       # Model-free values for stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Values for stage 2 (aliens)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # 1. Calculate Model-Based values: Transition Matrix * max(Q_stage2)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

        # --- Value Updating ---

```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free Learner with Eligibility Traces (TD(1))
This model assumes the participant ignores the transition structure entirely (Model-Free) but uses eligibility traces to connect the final reward back to the first-stage choice. This allows the reward obtained at the second stage to directly reinforce the first-stage action that led to it.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Learner with Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda=1)).

    This model ignores the transition structure. Instead, the reward received at the 
    second stage directly updates the first-stage action value. This is equivalent to 
    setting lambda=1 in a TD(lambda) algorithm, effectively performing Monte Carlo updates 
    for the first stage.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - lambda_trace: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay parameter.

### Model 3: Choice Perseveration Model (Hybrid + Stickiness)
This model extends the hybrid learner by adding a "stickiness" or perseveration parameter. Participants often repeat their previous choice regardless of reward (or switch away from it), which is a distinct behavioral signature from reinforcement learning.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    This model adds a 'stickiness' bonus to the action chosen on the previous trial.

    value or reward history.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    - stickiness: [-5, 5] Bonus added to the previously chosen action (positive = repeat, negative = switch).
