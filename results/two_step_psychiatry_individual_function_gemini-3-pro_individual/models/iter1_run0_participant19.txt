Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step task framework, exploring different mechanisms for learning and decision-making.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This model combines Model-Based (MB) planning, which uses the transition matrix to calculate expected values, and Model-Free (MF) learning, which learns from direct experience. A weighting parameter `w` determines the balance between these two systems. This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model for this task.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Model.
    Combines a model-based controller (using the transition matrix) and a model-free controller (SARSA).
    
    Parameters:

    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter. 1 = Pure Model-Based, 0 = Pure Model-Free.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    
    # Fixed transition matrix as per task description
    # A(0) -> X(0) (common), U(1) -> Y(1) (common)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

        # --- Learning Updates ---

```

### Model 2: Perseveration Model (Model-Free + Choice Stickiness)
This model is primarily a Model-Free learner but includes a "perseveration" parameter. This parameter captures the tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice regardless of the reward outcome, a common heuristic in human decision-making often distinct from reinforcement learning.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Perseveration (Stickiness).
    Adds a bias to repeat the previous first-stage action.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - perseveration: [0, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, perseveration = model_parameters

### Model 3: Eligibility Trace Model (TD(lambda))
This model implements TD($\lambda$), allowing the reward at the second stage to directly update the first stage choice, bridging the gap between the two steps more effectively than simple TD(0). The parameter `lambda` controls the decay of the eligibility trace.

    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - lam: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay parameter (lambda).
