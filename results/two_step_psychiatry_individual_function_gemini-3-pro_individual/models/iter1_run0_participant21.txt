Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step decision task. These models explore different mechanisms: a classic hybrid learner (mixing model-based and model-free), a model-free learner with eligibility traces (TD(lambda)), and a hybrid model that includes a perseverance (stickiness) bias.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This model is the "standard" explanation for this task. It assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of Model-Based planning (using the transition matrix) and Model-Free learning (learning from direct experience) to make the first-stage choice.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    This model computes Q-values for the first stage as a weighted sum of 
    Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) values.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Q-value updates.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w_mb: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_mb = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # Model-free value for stage 1 spaceships
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Model-free value for stage 2 aliens

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Decision ---
        # 1. Calculate Model-Based values: V(state) = max(Q(state, action))
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # 2. Combine MB and MF values
        q_net = w_mb * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w_mb) * q_stage1_mf
        
        # 3. Softmax choice
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial] # Actual planet arrived at

        # --- Stage 2 Decision ---
        # Standard Q-learning choice
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning ---
        # 1. Update Stage 1 MF (TD(0) update based on stage 2 value)
        # Note: In a simple SARSA/Q-learning setup, we update based on the value of the state reached
        # Here we use the value of the chosen action in stage 2 as the target
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # 2. Update Stage 2 MF (Reward prediction error)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: TD($\lambda$) Model-Free Learner
This model assumes the participant does *not* use the transition probabilities (pure Model-Free). However, unlike simple Q-learning, it uses an eligibility trace parameter ($\lambda$). This allows the reward at the second stage to directly influence the value of the first-stage choice, bridging the temporal gap more effectively than simple chaining.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    TD(lambda) Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    Uses eligibility traces to update first-stage values based on the final reward.
    This creates a direct link between the reward and the spaceship chosen.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    lambda_param: [0, 1] - Eligibility trace decay parameter.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, lambda_param = model_parameters

        # The value of the state reached is the value of the action taken there
        delta_1 = q_stage2[state_idx, chosen_a2] - q_stage1[chosen_a1]
        
        # Update stage 1 immediately
        q_stage1[chosen_a1] += learning_rate * delta_1

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Choice Perseverance (Stickiness)
This model extends the hybrid learner by adding a "stickiness" parameter. This captures the tendency of participants to repeat their previous choice (or switch) regardless of reward history, a common phenomenon in bandit tasks.

    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    w_mb: [0, 1] - Model-based weight.
    stickiness: [-5, 5] - Bias for repeating the previous choice (positive) or switching (negative).
