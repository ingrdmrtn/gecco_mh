Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task structure.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This model combines the Model-Free (TD) learning from your previous best model with a Model-Based planner. The Model-Based system uses the transition matrix to plan ahead, while the Model-Free system learns from direct experience. A weighting parameter `w` controls the balance between these two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner: Combines Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) value estimation.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0,1] Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described in the task (70% common, 30% rare)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # Model-free values for stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Values for stage 2 (same for MF and MB)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # 1. Calculate Model-Based values: Transition * Max(Stage 2 Values)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # 2. Combine MB and MF values
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        # 3. Choice probability
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---
        state_idx = state[trial] # 0 for Planet X, 1 for Planet Y
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Learning ---
        # Update Stage 1 MF (TD(0))
        # Note: In standard hybrid models, MF updates often use the value of the chosen stage 2 state
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # Update Stage 2 MF (Reward Prediction Error)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free with Eligibility Traces (TD(1))
This model is purely Model-Free but adds an "eligibility trace" parameter (`lambda`). This allows the reward received at the end of the trial to directly influence the value of the first-stage choice (Spaceship), skipping the intermediate step. This helps the agent learn the value of the first action faster than standard TD(0).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda)).
    Allows the reward at the second stage to directly update the first stage choice.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate (alpha).
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
    lambd: [0,1] Eligibility trace decay (0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, lambd = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Learning ---
        # 1. Prediction error at stage 1 (based on stage 2 value)
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        
        # 2. Prediction error at stage 2 (based on reward)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        
        # Update Stage 2 Q-value (standard TD)
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # Update Stage 1 Q-value:
        # It gets updated by its own error (delta_stage1) PLUS a portion of the stage 2 error (delta_stage2)
        # weighted by lambda. This connects the final reward to the first choice.
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * (delta_stage1 + lambd * delta_stage2)
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Choice Perseveration
This extends the Hybrid model by adding a "stickiness" or "perseveration" parameter. Participants often have a tendency to repeat their last choice regardless of reward (or switch away from it). This model captures that behavioral heuristic.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    Adds a bonus to the previously chosen action at stage 1.

    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
    w: [0,1] Balance between MB and MF.
    pers: [0,5] Perseveration bonus (positive = stickiness, negative = switching).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w, pers = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    # Track previous choice (initialized to -1 so it doesn't affect trial 0)
    last_action_1 = -1

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Combine MB and MF
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        # Add perseveration bonus to the net Q-values
        # We create a temporary Q-value array for decision making so we don't corrupt the actual learned values

        if last_action_1 != -1:
            q_decision[last_action_1] += pers

        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        # Store current action for next trial
