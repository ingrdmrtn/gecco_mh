Here are three cognitive models designed to explain the participant's behavior in the two-step task. They build upon the provided feedback by introducing mechanisms like Model-Based learning, eligibility traces, and distinct learning rates.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This model captures the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" hypothesis where human decision-making is a mixture of two systems: a Model-Free (MF) system that learns from direct experience (habitual), and a Model-Based (MB) system that plans using the transition structure of the task (goal-directed).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning model.
    Choice 1 is a weighted combination of MF and MB values.
    Choice 2 is purely MF (as it's the terminal state).
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w: [0, 1] - Mixing weight (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Fixed transition matrix for the MB system
    # Row 0: Spaceship A -> [Planet X, Planet Y] (0.7, 0.3)
    # Row 1: Spaceship U -> [Planet X, Planet Y] (0.3, 0.7)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning (TD Updates) ---
        # Update Stage 1 MF Q-value (TD(0) - no eligibility trace here for simplicity)

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))

```

### Model 2: TD(1) Learner (Eligibility Traces)
This model is purely Model-Free but differs from the simple TD(0) template. It uses an eligibility trace (lambda=1) to allow the reward at the second stage to directly reinforce the first-stage choice. This helps bridge the temporal gap between the first action and the final outcome more effectively than simple one-step updates.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free TD(1) Learning model.
    Uses an eligibility trace to update Stage 1 values directly based on Stage 2 rewards,
    ignoring the intermediate state value prediction error for the first stage update.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    lambda_param: [0, 1] - Eligibility trace decay (0=TD(0), 1=Monte Carlo).

### Model 3: Dual Learning Rate Model (Stage-Specific Plasticity)
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns about spaceship reliability (Stage 1) and alien generosity (Stage 2) at different speeds. For example, the probability of a spaceship transition is structural and static, whereas alien rewards drift slowly. A learner might adopt different learning rates for these distinct environments.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free learner with separate learning rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2.

    of the transition structure differently from the volatility of the reward structure.
    
    Parameters:
    lr_stage1: [0, 1] - Learning rate for spaceship choices.
    lr_stage2: [0, 1] - Learning rate for alien choices.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
