Here are three new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task. These models build upon the standard framework but introduce variations in how values are updated and combined.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free with Mixing Parameter
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of Model-Based (planning using the transition matrix) and Model-Free (learning from direct experience) strategies for the first-stage choice.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    This model posits that the agent's first-stage choice is a weighted mix of 
    a Model-Based strategy (planning via transition matrix) and a Model-Free strategy
    (TD learning). The mixing weight 'w' determines the dominance of the MB system.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated (for both stages).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choices (shared across stages).
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight. 1 = Pure Model-Based, 0 = Pure Model-Free.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)       # Model-free value for stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Model-free value for stage 2 (used by both systems)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # 1. Calculate Model-Based values: Transition * Max(Q_stage2)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # 2. Mix MB and MF values
        q_net = (w * q_stage1_mb) + ((1 - w) * q_stage1_mf)

        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Updates ---
        # TD Error for Stage 1 (update MF value)
        # Note: Standard SARSA-like update using the value of the state actually reached
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # TD Error for Stage 2 (update MF value)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free with Eligibility Traces (TD(1))
This model assumes the participant does *not* use the transition structure of the task at all. Instead, they rely purely on trial-and-error learning. Crucially, it uses an eligibility trace parameter (`lambda`) to allow the reward at the second stage to directly influence the value of the first-stage choice, skipping the intermediate state value update lag.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free TD(lambda) Model.
    
    This model ignores the transition matrix. It updates stage 1 values based on 
    stage 2 outcomes using an eligibility trace (lambda). This allows the reward 
    obtained at the end of the trial to 'drift back' to update the first choice 
    immediately.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - lam: [0, 1] Eligibility trace parameter (lambda). 0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo.

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

### Model 3: Model-Based with Choice Stickiness (Perseveration)
This model is primarily Model-Based (planning), but it accounts for a common behavioral heuristic: "stickiness" or perseveration. Participants often repeat their previous first-stage choice regardless of reward history. This model adds a parameter to bias the first-stage choice towards the action taken on the immediately preceding trial.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Based Model with Choice Stickiness (Perseveration).
    
    This model assumes the agent uses model-based planning but is also influenced 
    by a primitive tendency to repeat the last action taken (perseveration), 
    independent of reward.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate for updating stage 2 Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - stickiness: [0, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
