Here are 3 new cognitive models for the two-step decision task, designed to explore different mechanisms of learning and decision-making beyond the standard Model-Free baseline.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This model combines both model-based (planning using the transition matrix) and model-free (learning from direct experience) systems. A weighting parameter `w` controls the balance between these two systems during the first-stage choice. This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model, essential for capturing the trade-off between habit and planning.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure Model-Free, 1 = Pure Model-Based).

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) # Model-free values for stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Model-free values for stage 2 (aliens)
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)

```

### Model 2: Choice Kernel (Perseveration) Model
This model adds a "choice kernel" (CK) to the standard reinforcement learning framework. The choice kernel tracks the frequency of past choices, creating a tendency to repeat (perseverate) or switch actions regardless of reward. This helps explain the participant's highly repetitive behavior (choosing spaceship 1 five times in a row) which might not be solely driven by reward value.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for value-based choice.

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive vs Negative RPE)
This model differentiates between learning from positive prediction errors (getting a coin) and negative prediction errors (getting nothing). This captures "optimism" or "pessimism" biases, where a participant might learn quickly from gains but ignore losses, or vice versa.

import numpy as np
