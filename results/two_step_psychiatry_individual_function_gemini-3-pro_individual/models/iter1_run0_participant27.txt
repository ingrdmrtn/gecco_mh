Here are three cognitive models implemented as Python functions, filling in the provided template structure.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (TD-0)
This model assumes the participant does not use the transition structure (70%/30%) of the task at all. Instead, it learns the value of the spaceships (Stage 1) and the aliens (Stage 2) purely through trial-and-error using Temporal Difference (TD) learning.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (TD-0).
    
    The agent learns values for both the first-stage (spaceships) and second-stage (aliens)
    options based solely on experienced rewards and prediction errors. It does not use
    the transition matrix to calculate values (Model-Based planning is absent).

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] The rate at which Q-values are updated based on prediction errors.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]]) # Not used in MF policy
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        # In Pure MF, we only look at the learned MF values for stage 1
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # policy for the second choice
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
        
        # Calculate prediction errors
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        
        # ACTION VALUE UPDATING FOR CHOICE 1
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        
        # ACTION VALUE UPDATING FOR CHOICE 2
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free
This model posits that the participant's behavior is a weighted combination of habits (Model-Free) and planning (Model-Based). The Stage 1 choice is driven by a mix of the two value estimates.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner.
    
    The agent computes a 'Net' Q-value for the first stage which is a weighted 
    average of the Model-Based value (calculated via transition matrix) and the 
    Model-Free value (learned via TD).

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for MF Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - w: [0, 1] The weighting parameter. 1 = Pure Model-Based, 0 = Pure Model-Free.

    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        
        # ACTION VALUE UPDATING FOR CHOICE 2

```

### Model 3: Model-Free Learning with Choice Stickiness
This model accounts for the participant's tendency to repeat the same action regardless of the reward (perseverance). It adds a "stickiness" bonus to the Q-value of the action chosen in the immediately preceding trial.

```python

    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
