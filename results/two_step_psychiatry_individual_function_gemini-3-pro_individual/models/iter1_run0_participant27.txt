Here are 3 new cognitive models based on the two-step task structure, exploring different mechanisms like Model-Based learning, hybrid strategies, and perseverance.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Learner
This model assumes the participant builds an internal map of the task structure (transition probabilities) and plans their first-stage choice by calculating the expected value of the second stage. It ignores the direct "caching" of values from the first stage (Model-Free) and relies entirely on the computed values.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based learner.
    
    Calculates Stage 1 values by multiplying the known transition matrix with 
    the learned Stage 2 values. It does not use temporal difference learning 
    for Stage 1 choices.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate at which Stage 2 Q-values are updated [0,1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice [0,10].
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as per task description (A->X, U->Y commonly)
    # Rows: Action 1 (0 or 1), Cols: State (0 or 1)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for Stage 2: 2 states (planets) x 2 actions (aliens)
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Decision (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate max value available in each state
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2, axis=1)
        
        # Compute Model-Based values: Transition Probability * Best Next State Value
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mb)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Stage 2 Decision ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Learning ---
        # Only Stage 2 values are learned from reward. Stage 1 values are derived.
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of Model-Free (habitual) and Model-Based (goal-directed) strategies for the first-stage choice. A mixing parameter `w` controls the balance.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free learner.
    
    Combines Q-values from a TD learner (Model-Free) and a transition-matrix 
    planner (Model-Based) using a weighting parameter 'w'.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate for updating Q-values [0,1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax [0,10].
    - w: Weighting parameter [0,1]. 0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # MF values for Stage 1
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    # Values for Stage 2 (shared by MB and MF)
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Decision (Hybrid) ---
        # 1. Calculate Model-Based values
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2, axis=1)

        # Update Stage 1 MF (TD-learning using Stage 2 value as target)
        # Note: We use the value of the chosen stage 2 action, not the max (SARSA-like)
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseveration
This model is a Model-Free learner (like the one in the feedback) but adds a "perseveration" bonus. This accounts for the tendency to simply repeat the last action taken at Stage 1, regardless of the reward outcome. This is often a significant factor in human data on this task.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free learner with Choice Perseveration (Stickiness).
    
    Adds a bonus to the Q-value of the action chosen in the previous trial, 
    capturing the tendency to repeat choices regardless of reward.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate for updating Q-values [0,1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax [0,10].
    - perseveration: "Stickiness" bonus added to the previously chosen action [-5, 5].
      (Note: Bounds in optimizer should handle the range, usually small positive/negative).

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
