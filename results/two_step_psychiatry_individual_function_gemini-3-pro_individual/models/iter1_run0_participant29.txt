Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task structure.

### Model 1: Perseveration Hybrid Model
This model extends the standard hybrid learner by adding a "stickiness" or perseveration parameter. Participants often have a tendency to repeat their previous choice regardless of reward (habitual responding) or switch frequently. This model captures that tendency in the first-stage choice.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with a perseveration (stickiness) bonus for the first-stage choice.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] Weighting between MB (1) and MF (0).
    perseveration: [-5, 5] Bonus added to the previously chosen action (positive=stickiness, negative=switching).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w, perseveration = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Row 0: Spaceship A -> 70% Planet X (0), 30% Planet Y (1)
    # Row 1: Spaceship U -> 30% Planet X (0), 70% Planet Y (1)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)       
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  
    
    # Track previous choice for perseveration
    last_action_1 = -1 

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        # Add perseveration bonus if it's not the first trial
        if last_action_1 != -1:
            q_net[last_action_1] += perseveration

        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)

        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning ---
        # 1. Update Stage 2 Q-values (TD error at outcome)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # 2. Update Stage 1 Q-values (TD(1) logic: update based on Stage 2 outcome)
        # Note: We use the value of the chosen stage 2 state as the proxy for stage 1 outcome

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Separate Learning Rates Model
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns at different speeds for the two stages. It uses a pure Model-Free approach (no Model-Based component) but allows for distinct learning rates for the first-stage (spaceship choice) and the second-stage (alien choice), acknowledging that learning the value of a spaceship might happen differently than learning the immediate reward value of an alien.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free reinforcement learning with separate learning rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2.

    alpha2: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 (Aliens).
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    eligibility: [0, 1] Eligibility trace parameter (lambda), linking Stage 2 reward back to Stage 1.

```

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rate Model (Pos/Neg)
This model investigates if the participant reacts differently to positive outcomes (finding gold) versus negative outcomes (finding nothing). It splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`. This is often observed in clinical populations where sensitivity to reward and punishment differs. This is applied within a basic Model-Free framework.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    and negative (reward = 0) outcomes.

    alpha_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate when no reward is received (0).
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    """
    alpha_pos, alpha_neg, beta = model_parameters

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        else:
            current_alpha = alpha_neg

        # If the final outcome was good, we reinforce the path strongly; if bad, weakly (or vice versa).
