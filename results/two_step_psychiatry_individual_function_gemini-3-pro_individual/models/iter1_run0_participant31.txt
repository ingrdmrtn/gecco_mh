Here are 3 new cognitive models that explore different parameter configurations, specifically focusing on how learning rates and exploration parameters might differ between stages or outcome types.

### Model 1: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive vs. Negative)
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from positive prediction errors (receiving a reward better than expected) versus negative prediction errors (disappointment). This is a standard modification in reinforcement learning to account for optimism or pessimism bias.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Asymmetric Learning Rates:
    Distinguishes between learning from positive prediction errors (gains)
    and negative prediction errors (losses/omissions).

    Parameters:
    lr_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors (delta > 0).
    lr_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate for negative prediction errors (delta < 0).
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
    w: [0, 1] Weight mixing MB (1) and MF (0).
    """
    lr_pos, lr_neg, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)

        # Update Stage 1
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        eff_lr_1 = lr_pos if delta_stage1 > 0 else lr_neg
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += eff_lr_1 * delta_stage1
        
        # Update Stage 2
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]

        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += eff_lr_2 * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Stage-Specific Learning Rates
This model suggests that the plasticity (learning speed) differs between the two stages. The participant might update their valuation of the spaceships (Stage 1) at a different rate than they update the valuation of the aliens (Stage 2), perhaps due to the different nature of the transitions (stable vs. slowly drifting).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Stage-Specific Learning Rates:
    Uses separate learning rates for the first stage (spaceships) and 
    the second stage (aliens).

    lr_stage2: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 (Alien values).

    n_trials = len(action_1)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Independent Stage Exploration (Dual Beta)
This model relaxes the assumption that exploration noise is constant across the task. It allows for different "inverse temperatures" ($beta$) for the spaceship choice versus the alien choice. This captures the possibility that the participant is more decisive (or random) in one stage compared to the other.

    beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 (Spaceships).
