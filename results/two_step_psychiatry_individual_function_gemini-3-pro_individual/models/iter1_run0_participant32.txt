Here are 3 new cognitive models that expand on the standard reinforcement learning framework by introducing mechanisms for perseveration, separate learning rates for positive/negative outcomes, and eligibility traces.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Choice Perseveration
This model extends the standard hybrid model (Model-Based + Model-Free) by adding a "perseveration" parameter. This parameter captures a participant's tendency to repeat their previous first-stage action regardless of the reward outcome, a common phenomenon in human decision-making data.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free RL with Choice Perseveration.
    
    Adds a 'stickiness' parameter to the standard hybrid model, allowing the model
    to capture the tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = pure Model-Free, 1 = pure Model-Based).
    perseveration: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w, perseveration = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    # Track the previous action (initialize to -1 so no bonus on first trial)
    last_action_1 = -1

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Combine MF and MB values
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        # Add perseveration bonus to the previously chosen action
        if last_action_1 != -1:
            q_net[last_action_1] += perseveration
            
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)

        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial]

        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # Update Q-values
        # Note: In standard TD(0) for this task, the stage 1 update is often driven by the 
        # value of the CHOSEN stage 2 option, not the max.
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        last_action_1 = action_1[trial]

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive vs. Negative)
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from success (getting a coin) versus failure (getting nothing). It splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`. This is often useful for explaining risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviors where losses loom larger than gains (or vice versa).

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    and negative prediction errors (getting nothing/lower than expected).

    Parameters:
    alpha_pos: [0, 1] - Learning rate when prediction error is positive.
    alpha_neg: [0, 1] - Learning rate when prediction error is negative.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] - MB/MF weighting.

### Model 3: TD(lambda) Eligibility Trace Model
This model replaces the simple two-step update with an eligibility trace mechanism (`lambda`). Instead of just updating Stage 1 based on Stage 2 values, the reward obtained at the very end of the trial "flows back" to update the Stage 1 choice directly, scaled by lambda. This allows the model to learn the direct relationship between Spaceships and Coins without relying solely on the intermediate Planet state values.

import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    lam: [0, 1] - Eligibility trace decay (0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo).
