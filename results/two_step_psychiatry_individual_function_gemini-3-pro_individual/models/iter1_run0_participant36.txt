Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms of learning and decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Learner
This model assumes the participant builds a mental map of the task structure. Instead of just learning which spaceship is "good" based on recent rewards (model-free), it calculates the value of a spaceship by combining the known transition probabilities (70/30) with the learned values of the aliens on the planets. It represents a "planning" strategy.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Learner.
    This model calculates Stage 1 values strictly by planning: it combines the
    learned values of the second-stage states (aliens) with the fixed transition 
    matrix to compute expected value.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Rate at which second-stage Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Fixed transition matrix: 
    # Row 0 (Ship A) -> 0.7 to Planet X (0), 0.3 to Planet Y (1)
    # Row 1 (Ship U) -> 0.3 to Planet X (0), 0.7 to Planet Y (1)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Values for Aliens (Planet 0: 0,1; Planet 1: 0,1)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Decision (Model-Based) ---
        # 1. Determine the best value available on each planet
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1) # Shape (2,) for Planet 0 and Planet 1
        
        # 2. Compute Model-Based values for spaceships by multiplying transitions by max planet values
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # 3. Softmax choice for Stage 1
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mb)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        # --- Stage 2 Decision ---
        state_idx = state[trial] # Planet arrived at
        
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning ---
        # Only Stage 2 values are learned via prediction error. 
        # Stage 1 values are computed on the fly (planning) in the next loop.
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Learner (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It assumes the brain uses *both* strategies simultaneously. The final value used to choose a spaceship is a weighted sum of the Model-Free value (habitual, learned from direct experience) and the Model-Based value (planning, computed from the map). A mixing parameter `w` determines the balance.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner.

    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.

    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # Model-Free values for Stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Values for Stage 2 (Aliens)

### Model 3: Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseveration
This model is a Model-Free learner (like the template feedback) but adds a "Perseveration" parameter. Humans often have a "stickiness" bias where they tend to repeat their last action regardless of reward (or switch away from it). This model captures that low-level motor or cognitive repetition bias.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseveration.

    previous Stage 1 choice, independent of value.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
    perseveration: [-5, 5] Bias added to the previously chosen action. 
                   Positive = sticky, Negative = switching.
