Here are three new cognitive models based on the provided template and constraints.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model (MB/MF) with Choice Stickiness
This model combines Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) value estimation. Crucially, it adds a "stickiness" parameter, which captures the tendency of participants to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of reward history (perseveration).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model (MB/MF) with Choice Stickiness.
    
    Combines Model-Based and Model-Free values with a mixing weight (w).
    Adds a 'stickiness' bonus to the previously chosen action at Stage 1.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Update rate for Q-values [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax [0, 10].
    - w: Mixing weight [0, 1]. 1 = Pure MB, 0 = Pure MF.
    - stickiness: Choice perseveration bonus [0, 5]. 
                  Higher values mean more likely to repeat last choice.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w, stickiness = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

```

### Model 2: Asymmetric Learning Rate Model-Free
This model posits that the participant learns differently from positive prediction errors (receiving a reward unexpectedly) versus negative prediction errors (omission of expected reward). It uses two separate learning rates (`alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`) within a purely Model-Free framework.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free RL with Asymmetric Learning Rates.
    
    Uses different learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors.
    This captures potential biases towards learning from gains vs losses.
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_pos: Learning rate when prediction error > 0 [0, 1].
    - alpha_neg: Learning rate when prediction error < 0 [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax [0, 10].

### Model 3: Pure Model-Based with Value Decay
This model assumes the participant is purely Model-Based (planning based on transition probabilities) but has imperfect memory. The values of the aliens (Stage 2) decay back to a neutral point (0.5) if they are not visited, representing forgetting or uncertainty about unobserved options.

```python

    However, Stage 2 values decay towards 0.5 (neutral) on every trial,
    simulating forgetting or uncertainty about unchosen options.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Update rate for chosen Stage 2 options [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax [0, 10].
    - decay_rate: Rate at which Q-values decay to 0.5 [0, 1].

        # Decay for ALL aliens towards 0.5 (Apply decay before or after update is a design choice, 
        # here we apply decay to unchosen options implicitly by decaying everything then re-updating chosen)
        # However, a cleaner implementation for this specific loop structure:

        # Note: This effectively means the chosen one decays AND learns, others just decay.
        # We must re-add the learning step because we just decayed the whole matrix.
        # (Alternatively, iterate over indices, but matrix ops are cleaner).
        # Let's adjust: The chosen one has already been updated above. 
        # We will undo the decay for the chosen one or simply apply decay only to unchosen ones.
