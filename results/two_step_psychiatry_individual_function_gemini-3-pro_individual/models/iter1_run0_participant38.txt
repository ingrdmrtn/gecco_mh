Here are three cognitive models analyzing the participant's behavior in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This model combines model-free reinforcement learning (learning from direct reward experience) with model-based planning (using the known transition structure of the task). It weights these two systems using a mixing parameter `w`. This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style analysis for this task.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner: Weighted combination of Model-Based and Model-Free learning.
    
    The agent computes Q-values for the first stage using both a cached Model-Free (MF) 
    approach and a Model-Based (MB) approach that plans using the transition matrix.
    The final choice is a weighted sum of these two valuations.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] - Mixing weight (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Perseveration Learner
This model extends the basic reinforcement learning framework by adding a "perseveration" parameter. This captures the tendency of participants to repeat their previous choice (or switch) regardless of the reward outcome, representing a "sticky" or "switching" habit independent of value learning.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Perseveration Learner: TD Learner with choice stickiness.
    
    Adds a 'perseveration' bonus to the previously chosen action at Stage 1.
    If 'perseveration' is positive, the agent tends to repeat the last choice.
    If negative, the agent tends to alternate.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    perseveration: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the log-odds of repeating the previous stage 1 choice.

### Model 3: Separate Learning Rates (Positive vs Negative)
This model investigates asymmetry in learning. It hypothesizes that the participant might update their beliefs differently when receiving a reward (positive prediction error) versus receiving nothing (negative prediction error). This is often observed in clinical populations where sensitivity to gain or loss differs.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Asymmetric Learner: Separate learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors.
    
    This model splits the learning rate into alpha_pos (for RPE > 0) and 
    alpha_neg (for RPE < 0). This allows the agent to learn more from success 
    than failure, or vice versa.

    Parameters:
    alpha_pos: [0, 1] - Learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    alpha_neg: [0, 1] - Learning rate for negative prediction errors.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
