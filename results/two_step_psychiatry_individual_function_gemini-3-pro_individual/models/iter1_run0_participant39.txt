Here are 3 new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This model combines model-based (planning) and model-free (habitual) value estimation. It introduces a weighting parameter `w` to arbitrate between the two systems for the first-stage choice. This is a classic formulation for this task, allowing the agent to potentially use knowledge of the transition structure.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model (Model-Based + Model-Free).
    Arbitrates between a Model-Based (planning) strategy and a Model-Free (TD) strategy
    using a mixing weight 'w'.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate of updating Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w: [0, 1] - Weight for Model-Based control (1 = pure MB, 0 = pure MF).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described in the task (70% common, 30% rare)
    # Rows: Choice 0 (A), Choice 1 (B); Cols: State 0 (X), State 1 (Y)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) # Model-free Q-values for stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Q-values for stage 2 (State x Action)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Decision ---
        # Model-Based Value: V_MB(s1, a) = sum(P(s2|s1,a) * max(Q(s2, a')))

    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Separate Learning Rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2
This model is purely Model-Free but acknowledges that learning dynamics might differ between the abstract spaceship choice (Stage 1) and the concrete alien choice (Stage 2). By splitting `learning_rate` into `lr_1` and `lr_2`, the model can capture if the participant updates their high-level strategy at a different speed than their local reward estimates.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    the second-stage (alien) choice updates.
    
    Parameters:
    lr_1: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Stage 1 Q-values.
    lr_2: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Stage 2 Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive vs Negative Prediction Errors)
This model investigates if the participant learns differently from success (positive prediction errors) versus failure (negative prediction errors). This asymmetry is a common finding in reinforcement learning tasks, often linked to dopamine signaling or optimism/pessimism biases.

    alpha_neg: [0, 1] - Learning rate for negative prediction errors.
