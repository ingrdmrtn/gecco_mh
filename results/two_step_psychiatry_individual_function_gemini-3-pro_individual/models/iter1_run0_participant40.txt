Here are three cognitive models implemented as Python functions, ranging from a hybrid learner to models incorporating perseveration and separate learning rates.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This model implements the classic "hybrid" theory of reinforcement learning in this task. It assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of Model-Based (planning using the transition matrix) and Model-Free (TD learning) values to make decisions at the first stage.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner (Model-Based + Model-Free).

    This model combines Model-Free (MF) learning (TD errors) with Model-Based (MB) 
    planning. Stage 1 choices are driven by a weighted average of MF and MB values.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described in the task (70% common, 30% rare)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) # MF values for stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # MF values for stage 2 (also used for MB planning)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Calculate Model-Based values: Transition Matrix * Max Stage 2 Values
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Combine MF and MB values
        q_net = (w * q_stage1_mb) + ((1 - w) * q_stage1_mf)
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]

        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Updates ---
        # Note: In standard hybrid models, the MB system doesn't need updating here 
        # because the transition matrix is fixed/known. We only update MF values.
        
        # SARSA/TD(0) update for Stage 1 MF
        # We use the value of the state we actually arrived at (q_stage2_mf[state_idx...])
        # rather than the max, though Q-learning (max) is also valid.
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # Prediction error update for Stage 2
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free with Choice Perseveration
This model is a pure Model-Free learner (like the one in the feedback) but adds a "perseveration" parameter. This captures the tendency of participants to repeat their previous choice regardless of reward (stickiness), which is a common behavioral quirk in this task.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseveration.

    Adds a 'stickiness' parameter to the standard TD learner. This accounts for
    a tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice regardless of the outcome.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - perseveration: [0, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive vs Negative)
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (finding gold) versus negative outcomes (getting nothing or losing coins). It splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`.

```python

    negative (worse than expected).

    - alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    - alpha_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate for negative prediction errors.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
