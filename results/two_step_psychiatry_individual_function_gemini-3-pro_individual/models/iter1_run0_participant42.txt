Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task structure. These models explore different balances between model-free and model-based learning, as well as distinct choice mechanisms.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This model implements the classic "hybrid" architecture often used in two-step tasks. It assumes the participant's first-stage choice is a weighted combination of a Model-Based (planning) value and a Model-Free (habitual) value. This allows the model to capture behavior that is sensitive to transition structures (MB) but also reinforces simple stimulus-response associations (MF).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner.
    
    This model combines model-based planning (using the transition matrix) and 
    model-free learning (using direct reinforcement) to determine first-stage values.
    A mixing weight `w` determines the balance between these two systems.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight. 1 = Pure Model-Based, 0 = Pure Model-Free.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)       # Model-free values for stage 1 (Spaceships)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Model-free values for stage 2 (Aliens)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        # 1. Model-Based Value: Expected value of the best option at stage 2, weighted by transition probs
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # 2. Hybrid Value: Weighted sum of MB and MF values
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        # Softmax policy for stage 1

        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial] # Planet arrived at (0 or 1)

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        # Standard softmax on stage 2 Q-values

        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Learning Updates ---
        # Note: In standard TD(1) or similar hybrid models, the stage 1 MF value 
        # is often updated by the stage 2 value (SARSA-style) or the reward directly.
        # Here we use a simple TD update where the "reward" for stage 1 is the value of the chosen stage 2 state.
        
        # Update Stage 1 MF value using the value of the state we actually arrived at
        # (This captures the "habitual" path: I chose A, ended up at X, X is good -> A is good)
        chosen_stage2_value = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        delta_stage1 = chosen_stage2_value - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Perseveration / Choice Stickiness Model
This model builds on the pure model-based learner but adds a "stickiness" parameter. This captures the common behavioral tendency to repeat the previously chosen action regardless of reward or model structure (motor perseveration). This is often a crucial nuisance parameter in fitting real participant data.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Based Learner with Choice Perseveration (Stickiness).
    
    This model assumes Model-Based planning but adds a 'stickiness' bonus to the 
    previously chosen first-stage action. This accounts for motor repetition or 
    cognitive inertia unrelated to value learning.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which second-stage Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - stickiness: [-5, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.

### Model 3: Separate Learning Rates for Positive/Negative Prediction Errors
This model investigates valence asymmetry. It posits that the participant might learn differently from positive outcomes (finding gold) versus negative outcomes (no gold). This is a common finding in clinical populations (e.g., depression or addiction) where sensitivity to reward or punishment differs.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):

    one for positive prediction errors (better than expected) and one for 
    negative prediction errors (worse than expected).

    Parameters:
    - alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors (RPE > 0).
    - alpha_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate for negative prediction errors (RPE < 0).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
