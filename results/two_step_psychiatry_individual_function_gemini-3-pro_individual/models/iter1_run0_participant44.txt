Here are three new cognitive models based on the provided template and task description.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This model combines model-free learning (learning from direct experience) with model-based planning (using knowledge of the transition structure). This is the standard "Two-Step" model used in computational psychiatry to distinguish habit from planning. It uses a mixing parameter `w` to arbitrate between the two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner.
    
    Combines a Model-Free (TD) learner with a Model-Based learner that computes values
    using the known transition matrix. A mixing parameter 'w' controls the balance.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = pure MF, 1 = pure MB).

    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as per task description (A->X common, U->Y common)
    # Row 0: Spaceship A (0), Row 1: Spaceship U (1)
    # Col 0: Planet X (0), Col 1: Planet Y (1)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # Model-free values for stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Values for stage 2 (same for MF and MB)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # Model-Based Value Calculation: Bellman equation using max Q2 values
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

```

### Model 2: Perseveration Learner
This model extends the basic Reinforcement Learning framework by adding a "perseveration" bonus. This captures the tendency of participants to repeat their previous choice regardless of reward (or switch away from it), which is a common behavioral artifact in these tasks separate from value learning.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseveration.
    
    Adds a 'stickiness' parameter 'perseveration' that biases the subject to repeat 
    the previous stage 1 choice, independent of reward history.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    perseveration: [-2, 2] - Bonus added to the previously chosen action (positive = stick, negative = switch).
                             Note: Bounds in optimization should handle negative values if needed, 
                             but here we assume [0,1] mapped or similar. Let's assume standard [0,5] for magnitude.

### Model 3: Distinct Learning Rates (Stage 1 vs Stage 2)
This model hypothesizes that learning happens differently at the two stages. The first stage (choosing a spaceship) is more abstract and distal from the reward, while the second stage (choosing an alien) is proximal. This model allows for different learning rates (`lr_1` and `lr_2`) for the two stages.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    Allows for different plasticity (learning rates) at the two stages of the task.
    This can capture if a participant updates their spaceship preference slower or faster
    than their alien preference.
    
    Parameters:
    lr_1: [0,1] - Learning rate for Stage 1 (Spaceships).
    lr_2: [0,1] - Learning rate for Stage 2 (Aliens).
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
