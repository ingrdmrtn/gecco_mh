Here are 3 new cognitive models that explore different learning mechanisms such as eligibility traces, asymmetric learning (pos/neg), and stage-specific learning rates.

### Model 1: TD($\lambda$) Learner
This model implements a Model-Free learner with eligibility traces. In standard TD(0) learning, the first choice is only updated based on the value of the second stage state. In TD($\lambda$), the reward received at the very end can "propagate" back to update the first choice directly, scaled by the parameter $\lambda$. This helps the agent connect the initial choice to the final reward more quickly.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    TD(lambda) Learner.
    Uses eligibility traces to allow the final reward to directly influence 
    the value of the first-stage choice, bridging the gap between stages.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] The rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation balance).
    lambda_param: [0,1] Eligibility trace decay. 0 = TD(0) (standard), 1 = Monte Carlo.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, lambda_param = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        # Standard Softmax on MF values
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # policy for the second choice
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # Update Stage 1 (TD error based on Stage 2 Value)
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # Update Stage 2 (TD error based on Reward)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # Eligibility Trace Update: 
        # The Stage 2 error (delta_stage2) propagates back to Stage 1, scaled by lambda.
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * lambda_param * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive/Negative)
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from "good news" (positive prediction errors) versus "bad news" (negative prediction errors). This is a common finding in reinforcement learning psychology, where individuals may be more sensitive to rewards than punishments (or omissions of rewards), or vice versa.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Asymmetric Learning Rate Model.
    Applies different learning rates depending on whether the prediction error
    (delta) is positive (better than expected) or negative (worse than expected).

    Parameters:
    alpha_pos: [0,1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    alpha_neg: [0,1] Learning rate for negative prediction errors.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.

    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice

    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Stage-Specific Learning Rates
This model assumes the participant treats the two stages of the task differently. They might learn the value of the aliens (Stage 2, immediate reward) at a different speed than they learn the value of the spaceships (Stage 1, distal reward). This separates the learning rates for the first and second steps.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
