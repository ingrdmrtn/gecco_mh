Here are 3 new cognitive models based on the Two-Step Task literature.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free
This model implements the classic "Hybrid" theory (Daw et al., 2011). It assumes the participant's choice is a weighted mixture of a Model-Based system (which calculates values using the transition matrix) and a Model-Free system (which learns values via temporal difference error).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Model.
    
    The agent computes values using both a TD-learning strategy (MF) and 
    a planning strategy (MB) using the known transition matrix. The final 
    choice probability is a weighted combination of both.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which MF Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] Mixing weight. 0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # MF Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Policy for the first choice ---
        # 1. Calculate Model-Based Values (Planning)
        # Max value of each state at stage 2
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        # Bellman equation: Transition * Value
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # 2. Mix MB and MF values
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf

        state_idx = state[trial]

        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Updates ---
        # Update Stage 1 MF value (TD(0))
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # Update Stage 2 MF value (TD(0))
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free with Eligibility Traces (TD-$\lambda$)
This model assumes the agent is purely Model-Free but uses eligibility traces. When a reward is received at the second stage, it "drifts back" to update the first-stage choice directly, bridging the temporal gap. This allows the agent to learn the value of the first-stage spaceships faster than standard TD(0) learning.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Eligibility Traces (TD-Lambda).
    
    This model allows the reward prediction error at the second stage to 
    influence the value of the first stage choice, scaled by lambda.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    lambda_eligibility: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay parameter. 
                        0 = Standard TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo-like updates.

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

### Model 3: Model-Free with Choice Perseveration
This model addresses a common behavioral phenomenon where participants tend to repeat their previous action ("stickiness") regardless of the reward outcome. It adds a "perseveration" bonus to the Q-value of the previously chosen spaceship.

```python

    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    perseveration: [0, 5] Bonus added to the logit of the previously chosen action.

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    last_action_1 = -1 # Initialize with impossible action

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Policy for the first choice ---
        # Calculate logits (Q * beta)
        logits_1 = beta * q_stage1_mf
        
        # Add perseveration bonus if not the first trial
        if last_action_1 != -1:
            logits_1[last_action_1] += perseveration
