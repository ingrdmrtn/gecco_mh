Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step decision task. These models explore different mechanisms for learning and choice, distinct from the feedback provided.

### Model 1: Outcome-Specific Learning Rates (Reward vs. Punishment)
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (finding gold) versus negative outcomes (getting nothing). It splits the learning rate into `alpha_rew` (for rewards) and `alpha_pun` (for zero rewards). This is a pure Model-Free learner to establish a baseline for this specific asymmetry.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Asymmetric Model-Free Learner (Reward vs. Punishment).
    
    This model assumes the participant updates their values differently depending on
    whether they received a reward (gold coin) or not.
    
    Parameters:
    alpha_rew: [0,1] - Learning rate for rewarded trials (reward = 1).
    alpha_pun: [0,1] - Learning rate for unrewarded trials (reward = 0).
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    """
    alpha_rew, alpha_pun, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice (Pure Model-Free here)
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # policy for the second choice
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # Determine which learning rate to use based on the final outcome
        current_alpha = alpha_rew if reward[trial] == 1 else alpha_pun

        # Update Stage 1 (TD-0 style update using Stage 2 Q-value as proxy)
        # Note: Standard MF usually updates using the max of next stage or the chosen value.
        # Here we use SARSA-like update based on the chosen action at stage 2.
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += current_alpha * delta_stage1
        
        # Update Stage 2
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += current_alpha * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Eligibility Trace (TD-Lambda) Learner
This model introduces an eligibility trace parameter (`lambda`). Instead of just updating Stage 1 based on the transition to Stage 2, the reward received at the very end "leaks back" to update the Stage 1 choice directly. This bridges the gap between the first action and the final outcome more effectively than simple one-step updates.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    TD(Lambda) Learner.
    
    This model allows the reward at the second stage to directly influence the 
    value of the first stage choice via an eligibility trace parameter (lam).
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    lam: [0,1] - Eligibility trace decay (0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, lam = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # Using pure MF Q-values for decision making

        # Update Stage 1 value
        # It gets updated by its own immediate error (delta_stage1)
        # PLUS the error from the next stage (delta_stage2) scaled by lambda
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * (delta_stage1 + lam * delta_stage2)

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Separate Stage Temperatures
This model is a variation of the Hybrid (MB/MF) learner, but it acknowledges that the decision complexity differs between Stage 1 (planning/model-based) and Stage 2 (simple bandit). It fits two separate `beta` parameters: one for the high-level spaceship choice and one for the low-level alien choice.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate.
    beta_1: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for Stage 1 (Spaceship).
    beta_2: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for Stage 2 (Alien).
