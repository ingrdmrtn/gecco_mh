Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task. These models introduce eligibility traces, perseverance (stickiness), and separate learning rates for positive and negative outcomes to capture more nuanced behaviors than the standard hybrid model.

### Model 1: Model-Free with Eligibility Traces (TD($\lambda$))
This model implements a pure model-free Temporal Difference learning algorithm but adds an eligibility trace parameter ($\lambda$). This allows the reward received at the second stage to directly influence the value of the first-stage choice, bridging the gap between the action and the outcome without relying on a model-based transition matrix.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free TD(lambda) Model.
    
    This model uses eligibility traces to allow the second-stage reward to 
    update the first-stage Q-values directly, bridging the temporal gap.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Q-value updates.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    lambda_param: [0, 1] - Eligibility trace decay parameter (0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, lambda_param = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # No transition matrix needed for pure MF
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        # Pure MF decision at stage 1
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # policy for the second choice
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # Update Stage 1 based on Stage 2 value (TD(0) part)
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # Update Stage 2 based on reward
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # Eligibility trace update: 
        # The stage 1 action also gets updated by the stage 2 prediction error, scaled by lambda
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * lambda_param * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model with Choice Stickiness (Perseverance)
This model extends the standard Hybrid (MB/MF) model by adding a "stickiness" parameter. This parameter captures the tendency of participants to repeat their previous choice regardless of reward history (motor perseverance) or to switch frequently. This is a common nuisance parameter in two-step task modeling that often improves fit significantly.

    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    w_mb: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    stickiness: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.

    learning_rate, beta, w_mb, stickiness = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Asymmetric Learning Rates
This model investigates valence-dependent learning. It posits that the participant might update their value estimates differently when they receive a reward (positive prediction error) versus when they receive nothing (negative prediction error). It splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`.

    alpha_pos: [0, 1] - Learning rate for positive prediction errors (RPE > 0).
    alpha_neg: [0, 1] - Learning rate for negative prediction errors (RPE < 0).
