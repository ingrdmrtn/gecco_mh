Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Eligibility Traces (TD($\lambda$))
This model extends the standard Model-Free learning by adding an eligibility trace parameter (`lambda_eligibility`). Instead of just updating the first-stage value based on the second-stage value (TD(0)), the reward received at the very end also directly influences the first-stage choice, "tracing back" the credit. This is distinct from Model-Based learning but allows the agent to connect actions to distal rewards more effectively than simple TD learning.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free TD(lambda) Learner.
    
    This model incorporates eligibility traces, allowing the reward at the second stage
    to directly update the value of the first-stage choice, scaled by lambda.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    lambda_eligibility: [0, 1] eligibility trace decay parameter. 
                        0 = pure TD learning, 1 = Monte Carlo-like updates.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, lambda_eligibility = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) 
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]

        state_idx = state[trial] # The planet reached (0 or 1)

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx, :])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning ---
        
        # 1. Prediction error at stage 1 (driven by value of state reached)
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

        # 2. Prediction error at stage 2 (driven by reward)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # 3. Eligibility Trace update: Pass the Stage 2 RPE back to Stage 1
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * lambda_eligibility * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Based Learner
This model relies exclusively on a planning strategy. It assumes the participant knows the transition matrix (or learns it, but here we fix it as per the template's implication of "common/rare" transitions) and calculates the value of Stage 1 actions by computing the expected value of the best action at Stage 2. It does *not* maintain a separate cached Model-Free value for Stage 1 ($Q_{MF}(s1, a)$), forcing all first-stage decisions to be derived from the second-stage values.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Learner.

    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Action 1 -> 30% State 0, 70% State 1
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # We only store Q-values for the second stage (aliens)

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))

```

### Model 3: Perseveration Model (Model-Free + Choice Stickiness)
Often, participants simply repeat their previous choice regardless of reward (perseveration) or switch often. This model adds a `stickiness` parameter to the standard Model-Free learner. This parameter adds a "bonus" to the Q-value of the action taken on the previous trial, capturing habit-like behavior that is independent of reward history.

    beta: [0, 10] inverse temperature for softmax choice.
