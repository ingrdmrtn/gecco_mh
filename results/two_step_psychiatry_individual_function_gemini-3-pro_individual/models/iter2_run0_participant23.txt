Here are 3 new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms than the ones previously tested. These models introduce concepts like separate learning rates for the two stages, forgetfulness (decay), and a hybrid model that mixes model-based and model-free values at the first stage with a weighting parameter.

### Model 1: Separate Learning Rates for Stages (Stage-Specific Learning)
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns at different speeds for the first-stage decision (choosing a spaceship) versus the second-stage decision (choosing an alien). This is biologically plausible as the first stage involves planning or habit formation over abstract transitions, while the second stage is a direct bandit task.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Stage-Specific Learning Rates.
    Assumes the participant updates values for Spaceships (Stage 1) and Aliens (Stage 2)
    at different rates.

    Parameters:
    lr_stage1: [0,1] - Learning rate for the first stage (Spaceship choice).
    lr_stage2: [0,1] - Learning rate for the second stage (Alien choice).
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    """
    lr_stage1, lr_stage2, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1 = np.zeros(2)      # Values for Spaceships A, U
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Values for Aliens

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        a1 = action_1[trial]
        state_idx = state[trial] 

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
        
        a2 = action_2[trial]
        r = reward[trial]

        # --- Learning ---
        # Stage 2 update (Standard Q-learning)
        # Prediction error: Reward - Current Value
        delta_stage2 = r - q_stage2[state_idx, a2]
        q_stage2[state_idx, a2] += lr_stage2 * delta_stage2

        # Stage 1 update (TD-learning)
        # Prediction error: Value of state arrived at - Value of chosen spaceship
        # Note: We use the value of the chosen alien (Q_stage2) as the proxy for the state value V(s')
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2[state_idx, a2] - q_stage1[a1]
        q_stage1[a1] += lr_stage1 * delta_stage1

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Value Decay (Forgetting) Model
This model introduces a `decay` parameter. In standard reinforcement learning, unchosen options keep their values until they are chosen again. In this model, the values of *unchosen* actions decay toward 0 (or a neutral point) on every trial. This captures the idea that memory of specific reward values fades over time if not reinforced.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Value Decay (Forgetting).
    Unchosen action values decay towards 0 at each step, simulating memory loss.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for chosen actions.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    decay: [0,1] - Rate at which unchosen action values decay toward 0. 
                   (1 = no decay, 0 = instant forgetting).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, decay = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1 = np.zeros(2)      
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2)) 

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

        # Decay unchosen option in Stage 1
        unchosen_a1 = 1 - a1

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free with Mixing Parameter (w)
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style hybrid model. It calculates two values for the first stage: a Model-Free value (based on direct experience) and a Model-Based value (calculated using the known transition matrix and the max values of the second stage). The final choice is a weighted mixture of these two systems, controlled by parameter `w`.
