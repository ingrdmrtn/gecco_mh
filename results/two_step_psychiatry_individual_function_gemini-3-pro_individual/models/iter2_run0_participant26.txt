Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Perseveration + Model-Free Learning
This model hypothesizes that the participant relies on a simple Model-Free strategy but is strongly influenced by "choice stickiness" or perseveration. Instead of a complex model-based planner, they might simply tend to repeat their previous first-stage choice regardless of the outcome, combined with standard reward learning.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free RL with Choice Perseveration.

    Hypothesis: The participant uses model-free learning but has a tendency to 
    repeat their previous Stage 1 choice (perseveration), regardless of reward.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    perseveration: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action. 
                            Positive values mean sticking to choices; negative mean switching.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, perseveration = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # No transition matrix needed for pure MF, but keeping structure similar
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    last_action_1 = -1 # Initialize with an impossible action

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # Stage 1 Policy: Standard MF Q-values + Perseveration Bonus
        q_net = q_stage1_mf.copy()
        if last_action_1 != -1:
            q_net[last_action_1] += perseveration
            
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # Stage 2 Policy: Standard Softmax on Stage 2 Q-values
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # Update Stage 1 (TD(0) update towards Stage 2 Q-value)
        # Note: We use the Q-value of the chosen state/action pair as the target
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # Update Stage 2 (Standard Q-learning)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # Store action for next trial's perseveration
        last_action_1 = action_1[trial]

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Separate Learning Rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2
This model suggests that the participant learns at different speeds for the two stages of the task. Stage 1 involves abstract navigation (choosing a spaceship), while Stage 2 involves concrete rewards (getting coins). It is plausible that the credit assignment or learning plasticity differs between these contexts.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Dual Learning Rate Model-Free RL.

    Hypothesis: The participant learns the value of spaceships (Stage 1) and 
    aliens (Stage 2) at different rates.
    
    Parameters:
    lr_stage1: [0, 1] - Learning rate for first-stage choices.
    lr_stage2: [0, 1] - Learning rate for second-stage choices.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for both stages.
    """
    lr_stage1, lr_stage2, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += lr_stage1 * delta_stage1

        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda))
This model implements a TD($\lambda$) mechanism. Instead of updating Stage 1 values solely based on the Stage 2 Q-value (TD(0)), the reward received at the *end* of the trial directly influences the Stage 1 choice via an eligibility trace. This bridges the gap between the first action and the final outcome more directly than standard Q-learning.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    TD(lambda) Reinforcement Learning.

    Hypothesis: The participant uses eligibility traces to allow the final reward 
    to directly update the first-stage choice, bridging the delay.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    lambda_param: [0, 1] - Eligibility trace decay parameter.
