Here are 3 new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task. These models introduce variations in how eligibility traces are handled, how learning rates might differ for model-based vs model-free components, and how reward sensitivity might vary.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Eligibility Trace Decay (`lambda`)
This model introduces an eligibility trace parameter `lam` (lambda). In standard Q-learning (TD(0)), the stage 1 value is updated based on the stage 2 value. In TD(lambda), the stage 1 value is *also* directly updated by the final reward, weighted by `lam`. This allows the agent to credit the first-stage choice directly for the final outcome, bridging the gap between the two stages more effectively than simple one-step backup.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Eligibility Trace (TD-lambda):
    Uses an eligibility trace parameter `lam` to allow the stage 1 choice 
    to be updated directly by the stage 2 reward, in addition to the standard 
    TD(0) update from the stage 2 state value.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] Weight mixing Model-Based (1) and Model-Free (0) values.
    lam: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay parameter (0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo).

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

        # scaled by lambda. This connects the final reward to the first choice.

```

### Model 2: Separate Model-Based and Model-Free Learning Rates
Previous models often use a single learning rate for all updates or mix systems with a weight `w`. This model proposes that the Model-Free (MF) and Model-Based (MB) systems might learn at different speeds. Specifically, the "Model-Based" aspect relies on the values of the second stage states (`q_stage2_mf`), which act as the "model" of the environment's value. We separate the learning rate for the first stage MF values (`lr_mf`) from the learning rate for the second stage values (`lr_mb_support`), which support the MB calculation.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Separate Learning Rates for Stage 1 (MF) and Stage 2 (MB-support):
    This model posits that the direct caching of stage 1 values (pure MF) 
    happens at a different rate than the learning of stage 2 values, which 
    are critical for the MB planning calculation.
    
    Parameters:
    lr_mf: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1 MF Q-values.
    lr_mb_support: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 Q-values (used for MB planning).

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Reward Sensitivity
This model adds a `reward_sensitivity` parameter (often denoted as 'rho' in some literature, though here simply a scalar multiplier on the reward). Instead of treating the reward as exactly 0 or 1, the subjective utility of the reward is scaled. This allows the model to capture if the participant is hyper-sensitive or hypo-sensitive to the feedback, which effectively scales the magnitude of the prediction errors (`delta`) and thus the speed of value growth.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Reward Sensitivity:
    Introduces a parameter to scale the subjective value of the reward.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] Weight mixing MB (1) and MF (0).
