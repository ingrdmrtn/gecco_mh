Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step decision task, designed to explore different mechanisms of learning and decision-making while adhering to the specified constraints.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner (Model-Based + Model-Free) with Mixing Parameter `w`
This model is the classic "Hybrid" model often used in two-step tasks. It assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of a Model-Based strategy (which uses the transition matrix) and a Model-Free strategy (which relies on direct reinforcement).

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner.
    
    This model computes Stage 1 values as a weighted mixture of model-based (planning)
    and model-free (habitual) values.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choices.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter. 1 = purely Model-Based, 0 = purely Model-Free.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix for Model-Based calculation
    # Row 0: Spaceship A -> [Planet X, Planet Y], Row 1: Spaceship U -> [Planet X, Planet Y]
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # Model-free values for Stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Values for Aliens (Planet X: 0, 1; Planet Y: 0, 1)

        # --- Updates ---
        # TD(0) update for Stage 1 Model-Free value
        # Note: In pure TD(0), we update based on the value of the state we arrived at.
        # Here we use the max value of the next stage as a proxy for the state value V(s').

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free Learner with Separate Learning Rates for Reward and No-Reward
This model investigates valence-dependent learning. It hypothesizes that the participant updates their expectations differently when they receive a gold coin (positive prediction error) versus when they get nothing (negative prediction error).

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Asymmetric Learning Rates.
    
    This model assumes the participant learns differently from positive outcomes 
    (finding gold) versus negative outcomes (no gold).
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors (reward > expectation).
    - alpha_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate for negative prediction errors (reward < expectation).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choices.

    alpha_pos, alpha_neg, beta = model_parameters

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        if delta_stage1 > 0:
            q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += alpha_pos * delta_stage1

```

### Model 3: Model-Free Learner with Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda))
This model introduces an eligibility trace parameter (`lambda`). Instead of just updating the first stage based on the second stage's value (TD(0)), the reward received at the *end* of the trial also directly influences the first-stage choice, bridging the temporal gap.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    via an eligibility trace, rather than only chaining values backward.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - lambda_param: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay. 
                    0 = Pure TD(0) (Stage 1 updates only from Stage 2 value).
                    1 = Monte Carlo-like (Stage 1 updates fully from final reward).

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)

        # 2. Update Stage 2 Q-values (standard TD update)
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # 3. Update Stage 1 Q-values with Eligibility Trace
        # The Stage 1 value is updated by its own immediate PE (delta_stage1)
        # PLUS the PE from the second stage (delta_stage2) scaled by lambda.
        # This effectively passes the final reward outcome back to the first stage action.
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * (delta_stage1 + lambda_param * delta_stage2)
