Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step decision task, designed to explore different mechanisms than the pure Model-Free model provided in the feedback.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant is fully aware of the transition structure (0.7/0.3 probabilities) and calculates the value of Stage 1 actions by planning forward. Unlike the hybrid models often used, this one relies *exclusively* on model-based planning for the first stage choice, testing the hypothesis that this participant ignores direct reinforcement of stage 1 actions entirely.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning.
    
    This model assumes the participant calculates the value of stage 1 actions
    strictly by combining the transition matrix with the learned values of 
    stage 2 states (planning), rather than caching stage 1 values directly.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Rate at which stage 2 value estimates are updated.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described in the task
    # Row 0: Spaceship A (0) -> [0.7 to Planet X, 0.3 to Planet Y]
    # Row 1: Spaceship U (1) -> [0.3 to Planet X, 0.7 to Planet Y]
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for Stage 2 (aliens): 2 planets x 2 aliens
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # Calculate max value available at each planet
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Learning ---
        # Only Stage 2 values are learned via prediction error.
        # Stage 1 values are derived dynamically at the start of the next trial.
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Learner with Choice Perseveration
This model combines Model-Free (MF) and Model-Based (MB) strategies using a mixing weight `w`. Crucially, it adds a `perseveration` parameter. In two-step tasks, participants often repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of reward (motor perseveration) or switch frequently. This parameter captures that tendency, which is distinct from reinforcement learning.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    action.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    perseveration: [0,5] - Bonus added to the previous stage 1 choice (positive = sticky, negative = switchy).

### Model 3: Model-Free with Eligibility Traces (TD-Lambda)
This model is a variation of model-free learning. Instead of just updating the immediately preceding state, it uses an eligibility trace `lambda_param` to determine how much the Stage 2 reward should update the Stage 1 choice. If `lambda_param` is 1, the Stage 1 value is fully updated by the final reward (Monte Carlo/TD(1)). If 0, it is only updated by the transition to Stage 2 (TD(0)). This captures how credit is assigned across the two steps.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate.
