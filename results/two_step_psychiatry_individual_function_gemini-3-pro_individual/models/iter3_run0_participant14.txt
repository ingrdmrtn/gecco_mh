Here are three new cognitive models based on the provided template and participant data structure.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based (MB) Learner
This model assumes the participant fully utilizes the known transition structure of the task (70%/30% probabilities). Instead of learning Stage 1 values through trial-and-error (Model-Free), it calculates the expected value of Stage 1 choices by projecting the values learned at Stage 2 back through the transition matrix. It does not use `w` (mixing) or Stage 1 TD-learning.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based (MB) Model.
    
    The agent chooses at Stage 1 based solely on the calculated expected value 
    of the planets (Stage 2), weighted by the known transition probabilities.
    Stage 2 values are learned via standard Rescorla-Wagner.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Stage 2 Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) # Not used for decision, but kept for template structure
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Pure MB: Decision depends ONLY on q_stage1_mb
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mb)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # policy for the second choice
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # Action value updating
        # Note: In Pure MB, we do not update a Stage 1 MF value. 
        # We leave q_stage1_mf as zeros.
        
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseveration
This model builds on the "best so far" (Pure MF) but adds a "stickiness" parameter. This captures the common human tendency to repeat the previously chosen action regardless of reward history (motor perseveration). It ignores the Model-Based transition calculations.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    previous Stage 1 choice, regardless of the outcome.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    stickiness: [0, 5] Bonus added to the logit of the previously chosen action.

    last_choice = -1

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        # We calculate MB values as per template, but ignore them for this model

### Model 3: Model-Free Learner with Asymmetric Learning Rates
This model hypothesizes that the participant updates their beliefs differently when receiving a reward (Positive Prediction Error) versus receiving nothing (Negative Prediction Error). This "optimism bias" or "pessimism bias" is a common variation in reinforcement learning models.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):

    than expected) and negative prediction errors (worse than expected).

    lr_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate when prediction error is positive.
    lr_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate when prediction error is negative.
