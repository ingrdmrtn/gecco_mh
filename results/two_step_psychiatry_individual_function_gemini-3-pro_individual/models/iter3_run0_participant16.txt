Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step decision task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (Classic Daw et al. 2011)
This model combines model-free (habitual) and model-based (goal-directed) learning. The `w` parameter controls the weighting between these two systems. It updates the first-stage values using a mix of TD errors and a Bellman equation calculation based on the transition structure.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Classic Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free RL.
    
    Combines a Model-Free learner (TD(1)) with a Model-Based learner that calculates 
    expected value using the transition matrix. A mixing weight 'w' determines
    the balance between these two strategies for the first-stage choice.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice stochasticity.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as per task description
    # A (0) -> X (0) w/ 0.7; U (1) -> Y (1) w/ 0.7
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)       # Model-free values for Stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Values for Stage 2 (aliens) - shared by MB and MF

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        # 1. Calculate Model-Based values (Q_MB)
        # Max value of each state (planet)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

        # --- Transition ---
        state_idx = state[trial] # Actual planet arrived at

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        # Standard softmax on Q-values for the current state
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)

        # --- Learning ---

        # In the classic formulation, MF stage 1 is updated by the reward directly (lambda=1)

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free TD(0) (SARSA-style)
This model represents a simpler habit-learning agent than the one provided in the feedback. Instead of looking all the way to the final reward to update the first stage (TD(1)), it updates the first-stage value based on the value of the *state* it arrived at (TD(0)). This makes the agent sensitive to the immediate transition but purely through cached values, not a model of the world.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (TD(0)).
    
    Unlike the TD(1) model, this agent updates the first-stage action value 
    based on the value of the second-stage state it lands in, rather than the 
    final reward. This is a classic temporal difference learning mechanism.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice stochasticity.

    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Choice Perseveration
This extends the hybrid MB/MF model by adding a "perseveration" parameter `p`. Humans often repeat their previous choice regardless of reward (stickiness). This model captures that tendency, which is distinct from reinforcement learning.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF Model with Choice Perseveration.
    
    Adds a 'stickiness' parameter 'p' to the hybrid model. This parameter captures 
    the tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice regardless of the outcome, 
    accounting for motor perserveration or cognitive inertia.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    p: [0, 5] - Perseveration bonus added to the previously chosen action's value.

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
