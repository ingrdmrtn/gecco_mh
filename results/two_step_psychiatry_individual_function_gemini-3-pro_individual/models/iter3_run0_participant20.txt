Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates for Stages
This model hypothesizes that participants might learn at different speeds for the first-stage choice (which is more abstract and distal from the reward) versus the second-stage choice (which is proximal to the reward). It combines model-based and model-free values but allows `alpha_stage1` and `alpha_stage2` to differ.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates.
    
    This model assumes the participant learns the value of the first-stage actions
    (spaceships) at a different rate than the second-stage actions (aliens).
    It combines MB and MF systems using a mixing weight 'w'.
    
    Parameters:
    alpha_stage1: [0,1] - Learning rate for stage 1 Q-values.
    alpha_stage2: [0,1] - Learning rate for stage 2 Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    alpha_stage1, alpha_stage2, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Calculate Model-Based value
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Hybrid value
        q_hybrid = (w * q_stage1_mb) + ((1 - w) * q_stage1_mf)
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_hybrid)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Updates ---
        # Update Stage 1 MF value using its specific learning rate
        # Note: Standard TD uses max(Q(s', a')) but here we often use the value of the chosen option
        # or the max. Here we follow standard SARSA-like updates for the two-step task common in literature.
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += alpha_stage1 * delta_stage1
        
        # Update Stage 2 MF value using its specific learning rate
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += alpha_stage2 * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free Learner with Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda))
This model abandons the explicit Model-Based component and instead relies on a pure Model-Free `TD(lambda)` algorithm. The parameter `lambda` controls how much the reward at the second stage updates the value of the first stage directly. A high `lambda` allows the first-stage choice to be credited for the reward almost as much as the second-stage choice, mimicking some aspects of planning without a transition model.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free TD(lambda) Learner.
    
    Uses eligibility traces to update first-stage values based on second-stage outcomes.
    This avoids explicit model-based planning but allows credit assignment to bridge the delay.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    lam: [0,1] - Eligibility trace decay (lambda). 0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo-like updates.

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with "Forgetful" Q-values
This model introduces a decay parameter. In dynamic environments, old information becomes stale. This model assumes that unchosen action values decay toward a neutral point (0 or 0.5) or simply decay in magnitude over time. This helps the model adapt when probabilities flip or drift.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    Combines Model-Based and Model-Free learning, but includes a decay parameter.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for chosen Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    decay: [0,1] - Rate at which Q-values decay toward 0 (1 = no decay, 0 = instant forgetting).
