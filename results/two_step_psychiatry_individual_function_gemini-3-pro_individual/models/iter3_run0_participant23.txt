Here are three new cognitive models based on the provided template and participant data.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner (Standard Daw Model)
This model implements the classic "hybrid" architecture often used for this task. It assumes decision-making is a weighted combination of a Model-Based system (which uses the transition matrix to plan) and a Model-Free system (which learns from direct experience). The weighting parameter `w_mb` determines the balance.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner (Daw et al., 2011).
    Combines Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) value estimation.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w_mb: [0, 1] - Weight of model-based control (0 = pure MF, 1 = pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_mb = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Fixed transition matrix for the task (70% common, 30% rare)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)       # Model-free Q-values for stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Model-free Q-values for stage 2 (Aliens)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Decision ---
        # 1. Calculate Model-Based values for Stage 1
        # Max Q-value available at each state (planet)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        # Expected value of each spaceship based on transition probabilities

        # Note: In the standard hybrid model, the stage 2 reward often also updates stage 1 MF values
        # via an eligibility trace (lambda), but here we keep it simple as defined by w_mb mixing.
        # However, to strictly follow the "Standard Daw" logic, the Stage 1 MF value also usually 
        # gets a second update from the stage 2 RPE (effectively lambda=1).

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Perseveration Model (Habitual Stickiness)
This model adds a "stickiness" or perseveration parameter. In behavioral data, participants often repeat their previous choice regardless of reward (or switch away from it). This model captures that tendency by adding a bonus to the `Q` value of the previously chosen action.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseveration.
    
    Adds a 'stickiness' parameter that biases the agent to repeat 
    (or avoid) the immediately preceding choice at Stage 1.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    perseveration: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the previous choice's value (positive = repeat, negative = switch).

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive/Negative)
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (rewards) versus negative outcomes (omission of rewards). It splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`. This is common in psychiatry research where sensitivity to reward vs. punishment may differ.

```python
import numpy as np

    alpha_neg: [0, 1] - Learning rate for negative prediction errors (delta < 0).
