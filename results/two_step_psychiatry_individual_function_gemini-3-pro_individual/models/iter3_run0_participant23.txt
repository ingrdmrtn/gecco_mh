Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task. These models introduce concepts like eligibility traces for direct reinforcement, separate learning rates for different stages, and a hybrid model-based/model-free architecture with a forgetting mechanism.

### Model 1: TD(1) / Direct Reinforcement Learner
This model implements a form of temporal difference learning where the second-stage reward directly reinforces the first-stage choice, bypassing the second-stage value estimate. This is often called "direct reinforcement" or TD(1) in this context. It captures the idea that participants might simply repeat the first-stage action that ultimately led to a reward, regardless of the transition structure.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    TD(1) / Direct Reinforcement Learner.
    The first-stage choice is updated directly by the final reward, scaled by lambda.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Standard Q-learning rate.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    lambda_eligibility: [0,1] - Eligibility trace parameter. 
                                0 = standard TD(0) (update via stage 2 value).
                                1 = Monte Carlo / Direct Reinforcement (update via reward).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, lambda_eligibility = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1 = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # Stage 1 Choice
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        a1 = action_1[trial]
        state_idx = state[trial] # 0 or 1

        # Stage 2 Choice
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
        
        a2 = action_2[trial]
        r = reward[trial]

        # Prediction Errors
        # Stage 2 PE: Reward minus Stage 2 Value
        delta_2 = r - q_stage2[state_idx, a2]
        
        # Stage 1 PE: Stage 2 Value minus Stage 1 Value
        delta_1 = q_stage2[state_idx, a2] - q_stage1[a1]

        # Update Stage 2
        q_stage2[state_idx, a2] += learning_rate * delta_2
        
        # Update Stage 1
        # Combined update: Standard TD(0) part + Eligibility Trace part (Direct Reinforcement)
        # If lambda=0, update is lr * delta_1 (TD(0))
        # If lambda=1, update is lr * (delta_1 + delta_2) = lr * (r - Q1) (Monte Carlo)
        q_stage1[a1] += learning_rate * (delta_1 + lambda_eligibility * delta_2)

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Stage-Specific Learning Rates
This model hypothesizes that learning happens at different speeds for the high-level planning (spaceship choice) versus the low-level bandit task (alien choice). It uses separate learning rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2 updates, allowing the model to capture participants who might be quick to change their spaceship preference but slow to update their beliefs about specific aliens (or vice versa).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Dual Learning Rate Model-Free Learner.
    Uses separate learning rates for the first and second stage updates.

    Parameters:
    lr_stage1: [0,1] - Learning rate for the first decision stage.

    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    """
    lr_stage1, lr_stage2, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

        q_stage2[state_idx, a2] += lr_stage2 * delta_2

        # Update Stage 1 Q-values
        # Using the standard TD(0) update rule but with a specific stage 1 learning rate

        q_stage1[a1] += lr_stage1 * delta_1

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Choice Stickiness
This model combines Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) learning strategies, but adds a "stickiness" parameter. Stickiness (or perseveration) captures the tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward history. This is a very common nuisance parameter in reinforcement learning models of this task, often explaining significant variance.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

        # We must reconstruct the pre-update Q2 for the target to be rigorous TD(0),
