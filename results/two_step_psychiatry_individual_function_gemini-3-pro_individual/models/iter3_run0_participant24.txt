Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task paradigm. These models explore different mechanisms such as perseveration, separate learning rates for positive/negative outcomes, and a hybrid model-based/model-free approach with a specific mixing parameter.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (MB/MF)
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It posits that the participant uses a weighted combination of a Model-Free system (TD learning) and a Model-Based system (planning using the transition matrix). This is the most crucial theoretical model for this task.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning.
    
    The first-stage choice is a weighted sum of Model-Free Q-values (learned via TD)
    and Model-Based Q-values (calculated via the transition matrix and stage 2 values).
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    
    # Fixed transition matrix: 
    # Row 0: prob of reaching state 0/1 from action 0 (Common/Rare)
    # Row 1: prob of reaching state 0/1 from action 1 (Rare/Common)
    # Assuming standard setup: Action A->X (0.7), Action U->Y (0.7)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) 
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # Max Q-value available at each state (0 or 1)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning ---
        # 1. Update Stage 1 MF value using SARSA-style TD error
        # Note: In pure MF, the target is the Q-value of the chosen second stage action

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free with Choice Perseveration
This model is purely Model-Free (like the one in your feedback), but it adds a "perseveration" parameter. Participants often have a "stickiness" bias where they repeat their previous first-stage choice regardless of the reward, simply out of motor repetition or cognitive inertia.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free TD Learning with Choice Perseveration (Stickiness).
    
    Adds a bias term to the Q-values of the first stage based on the previous choice.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    perseveration: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.

```

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive vs Negative)
This model investigates if the participant learns differently from wins (getting a coin) versus losses (getting nothing). It splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`. This is common in psychiatry research (e.g., depression or anxiety influencing sensitivity to punishment/reward).

```python

    and negative prediction errors (worse than expected).
    
    Parameters:
    alpha_pos: [0, 1] - Learning rate for positive prediction errors (delta > 0).
    alpha_neg: [0, 1] - Learning rate for negative prediction errors (delta < 0).
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
