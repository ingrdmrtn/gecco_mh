Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms and parameter combinations not yet listed in the feedback.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2
This model hypothesizes that the participant might learn about the spaceships (Stage 1) at a different speed than they learn about the aliens (Stage 2). For instance, the transition structure is stable, but the reward probabilities drift, suggesting different optimal learning rates.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates.
    
    This model assumes the participant is a hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free learner

    and the second stage (rewards).
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate_1: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1 (TD(0) update).
    learning_rate_2: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 (Reward update).

    learning_rate_1, learning_rate_2, beta, w = model_parameters

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free Learner with Reward Sensitivity (Outcome Scaling)
This model introduces a `reward_sensitivity` parameter. Instead of treating the reward strictly as 0 or 1, the participant might subjectively perceive the reward (or lack thereof) with different magnitudes. This acts as a scaling factor on the prediction error, distinct from the learning rate which controls the integration speed.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Q-Learning with Reward Sensitivity.
    
    This model assumes the participant is a standard TD learner but scales
    the incoming reward signal by a sensitivity parameter. This captures 
    how much the participant 'cares' about the outcome magnitude.

    learning_rate: [0, 1]
    beta: [0, 10]
    reward_sensitivity: [0, 10] Scaling factor for the reward signal.

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Inverse Temperature (Beta) for Stage 1 vs Stage 2
This model suggests that the exploration/exploitation trade-off differs between the two stages. The participant might be very deterministic (high beta) when choosing a spaceship but very exploratory (low beta) when choosing an alien, or vice versa.
