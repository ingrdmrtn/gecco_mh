Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step decision task structure.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant fully utilizes the transition structure of the task. Instead of learning Stage 1 values directly from reward prediction errors (like Model-Free), it calculates the value of Stage 1 actions by planning forward: it combines the known transition probabilities with the learned values of the Stage 2 states (aliens).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Model.

    This model calculates Stage 1 values (Q_MB) by combining the learned Stage 2 
    values with the fixed transition matrix. It does not maintain separate 
    Stage 1 model-free values.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate at which Stage 2 Q-values are updated [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice [0, 10].
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Fixed transition matrix (approximate knowledge of the task structure)
    # Rows: Action 1 (Spaceship 0, Spaceship 1)
    # Cols: State (Planet 0, Planet 1)
    # Assumption: Action 0 -> Planet 0 (Common), Action 1 -> Planet 1 (Common)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Q-values for Stage 2 (Aliens)
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Decision (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate the max value available at each planet
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        
        # Bellman equation: Q(s1, a1) = Sum(P(s2|s1,a1) * max(Q(s2, a2)))
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mb)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

        state_idx = state[trial] # The planet arrived at

        # --- Stage 2 Decision ---
        qs_current_state = q_stage2_mf[state_idx]
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * qs_current_state)
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning ---
        # Only Stage 2 values are updated via TD learning
        # There is no Stage 1 TD update because values are derived on the fly
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (The "Daw" Model)
This is the classic interpretation of this task. The participant computes both a Model-Based value (planning) and a Model-Free value (habit) for the first stage. The final decision is a weighted combination of these two systems, controlled by a mixing parameter `w`.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Model.

    The Stage 1 Q-value is a weighted average of Model-Based (planning) and 
    Model-Free (TD) values.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate for Q-value updates [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature [0, 10].
    - w: Weighting parameter [0, 1]. (1 = Pure MB, 0 = Pure MF).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # Model-free values for Stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Model-free values for Stage 2 (Aliens)

        # Update Stage 2 MF value based on reward
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]

### Model 3: Model-Free with Choice Perseveration
This model operates purely on model-free principles (ignoring transition structure) but adds a "perseveration" parameter. This captures the tendency of participants to simply repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of reward, a common behavioral heuristic often confounded with learning.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learning with Choice Perseveration.

    Adds a 'stickiness' bonus to the previously chosen action in Stage 1,
    capturing habit-like repetition independent of reward history.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate for Q-value updates [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature [0, 10].
    - perseveration: Bonus added to the previous Stage 1 choice logits [-5, 5].
      (Positive values = stickiness, Negative values = alternation).
