Here are three new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms than the standard hybrid model with perseveration. These models introduce eligibility traces, separate learning rates for positive/negative outcomes, and a specific "model-based" parameter that scales with reward prediction error.

### Model 1: TD(lambda) Learner (Eligibility Traces)
This model moves away from the strict separation of Model-Based and Model-Free learning and instead uses temporal difference learning with eligibility traces (TD($\lambda$)). The parameter `lam` (lambda) controls how much credit the first-stage choice gets for the second-stage reward directly, bridging the gap between the two stages without explicitly calculating transition matrices.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    TD(lambda) Learner.
    
    Uses eligibility traces to update Stage 1 values based on Stage 2 outcomes directly.
    This creates a form of model-free learning that bridges the delay between 
    Stage 1 choice and final reward more effectively than simple TD(0).
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Rate for updating Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    lam: [0,1] Decay rate for eligibility traces (0=TD(0), 1=Monte Carlo).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, lam = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Initialize Q-values
    q_stage1 = np.zeros(2) + 0.5
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2)) + 0.5
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        a1 = action_1[trial]
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2[state_idx, :])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
        
        a2 = action_2[trial]
        r = reward[trial]

        # --- Updates ---
        # Prediction error at stage 1 (based on stage 2 value)
        delta_1 = q_stage2[state_idx, a2] - q_stage1[a1]
        
        # Prediction error at stage 2 (based on reward)
        delta_2 = r - q_stage2[state_idx, a2]
        
        # Update Stage 1: Standard TD update + Eligibility trace from Stage 2 error
        # The trace is effectively 1 for the chosen action a1.
        q_stage1[a1] += learning_rate * delta_1 + learning_rate * lam * delta_2
        
        # Update Stage 2
        q_stage2[state_idx, a2] += learning_rate * delta_2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Asymmetric Learning Rate (Dual-Alpha) Model
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (gains) versus negative outcomes (absence of reward). This is a pure Model-Free learner (to contrast with the complex hybrid models) but adds nuance to *how* values are updated.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    when the prediction error is positive (better than expected) versus 
    negative (worse than expected).
    
    Parameters:
    alpha_pos: [0,1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    alpha_neg: [0,1] Learning rate for negative prediction errors.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature for softmax.

    alpha_pos, alpha_neg, beta = model_parameters

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Inverse Temperature Modulation
This model is a hybrid learner (mixing Model-Based and Model-Free), but instead of a fixed weighting parameter `w`, it introduces a mechanism where the exploration/exploitation balance (`beta`) is modulated by the `w` parameter. This implies that as the agent relies more on the model-based strategy, their decision noise might change.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
