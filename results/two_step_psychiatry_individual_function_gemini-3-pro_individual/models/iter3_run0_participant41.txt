Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step task framework, exploring different balances between model-based and model-free learning, as well as perseveration.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Learner
This model assumes the participant fully utilizes the transition structure of the task. Instead of learning the value of the first-stage actions directly from reward prediction errors (like the Model-Free learner), it calculates the value of first-stage actions by combining the known transition probabilities with the learned values of the second-stage states.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning.
    
    This model calculates stage 1 values by planning: it combines the known 
    transition matrix with the learned values of the second-stage options.
    It assumes the participant knows spaceship A -> Planet X and U -> Planet Y.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which stage 2 Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Transition matrix: T[action_1, state]
    # Action 0 -> 70% State 0, 30% State 1
    # Action 1 -> 30% State 0, 70% State 1
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Values of aliens (state, alien)
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Decision (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate max value available at each second-stage state
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        
        # Bellman equation: Q_MB(a1) = sum(P(s2|a1) * max(Q(s2, a2)))
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mb)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

        a1 = action_1[trial]
        
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
        
        # --- Learning ---
        a2 = action_2[trial]
        r = reward[trial]

        # Only stage 2 values are updated via TD error; stage 1 is computed on the fly
        delta_stage2 = r - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This is the classic "Daw 2011" style model. It assumes the brain maintains two parallel valuation systems: a model-free system (habitual, TD learning) and a model-based system (goal-directed, planning). The final choice at the first stage is a weighted combination of both systems.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    and Model-Free (TD) values. The weight is controlled by parameter `w`.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter. 1 = Pure Model-Based, 0 = Pure Model-Free.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # Model-free values for stage 1

        # Note: In full SARSA(lambda) models, this might use an eligibility trace, 
        # but here we use simple TD(0) for stage 1 based on stage 2 value.
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] - q_stage1_mf[a1]

### Model 3: Model-Free with Choice Perseveration
This model is a variation of the pure Model-Free learner but adds a "perseveration" parameter. Humans often have a tendency to repeat their last choice regardless of the reward (stickiness). This model captures that bias at the first stage, separating motor repetition from value-based learning.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Choice Perseveration (Stickiness).
    
    Adds a 'stickiness' bonus to the action chosen on the previous trial,
    capturing the tendency to repeat actions regardless of reward outcome.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - perseveration: [0, 5] Bonus added to the previously chosen action (logits).
