Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task structure.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free (MB/MF)
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It posits that participants use a mixture of two systems: a Model-Free (MF) system that learns from direct reward prediction errors, and a Model-Based (MB) system that plans using the known transition structure of the task. A mixing parameter `w` controls the balance between these two systems for the first-stage choice.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning.
    
    This model combines two valuation strategies:
    1. Model-Based (MB): Computes values by planning through the transition matrix.
    2. Model-Free (MF): Learns values directly from experience (TD learning).
    
    A weighting parameter 'w' determines the influence of each system on the stage 1 choice.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for value estimates (alpha).
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0,1] - Weight of model-based control (0 = pure MF, 1 = pure MB).

    # Spaceship A (0) -> 0.7 to Planet X (0), 0.3 to Planet Y (1)
    # Spaceship U (1) -> 0.3 to Planet X (0), 0.7 to Planet Y (1)

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) 

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

        # Stage 1 Update (TD-0 style, using Q-value of chosen stage 2 action)

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Perseverance (Choice Stickiness) Model
This model extends the basic reinforcement learning framework by adding a "perseverance" or "stickiness" parameter. This captures the tendency of participants to repeat their previous choice regardless of reward history, a phenomenon often observed in behavioral data. This is modeled as a bonus added to the Q-value of the action taken on the immediately preceding trial.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free RL with Choice Perseverance (Stickiness).

    previous stage-1 choice, independent of reward history.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for value estimates.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    stickiness: [0,5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.

### Model 3: Separate Learning Rates for Positive/Negative Outcomes
This model investigates valence-dependent learning. It hypothesizes that the participant might update their value estimates differently when they receive a reward (positive prediction error) versus when they receive no reward (negative prediction error). This is captured by splitting `learning_rate` into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`.

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    (worse than expected).
    
    Parameters:
    alpha_pos: [0,1] - Learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    alpha_neg: [0,1] - Learning rate for negative prediction errors.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
