Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task. These models move beyond the pure Model-Free TD(1) approach you identified as your best so far, exploring mechanisms like Model-Based learning, hybrid strategies, and perseverance.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (Standard Daw Model)
This model implements the classic "hybrid" hypothesis. It assumes the participant maintains two sets of values for the first stage: a Model-Free (MF) value learned from experience, and a Model-Based (MB) value calculated from the transition matrix and second-stage values. A weighting parameter `w` controls the balance between these two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning.
    
    This model combines Model-Free (TD(1)) values and Model-Based values 
    weighted by a mixing parameter 'w'.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    
    # Fixed transition matrix for the MB system (70% common, 30% rare)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)       
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        # Calculate Model-Based values: Transition * Max(Q_stage2)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Combine MF and MB values

        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning ---
        # Update Stage 2 Q-values (Standard Rescorla-Wagner)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

        delta_stage1 = reward[trial] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free with Choice Perseverance
This model builds on your previous best (TD(1)) but adds a "perseverance" parameter `p`. Humans often repeat their previous choice regardless of reward (stickiness). This model tests if the participant is simply driven by reward history plus a raw tendency to repeat (or switch) their last Stage 1 action.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free RL (TD(1)) with Choice Perseverance.
    
    Adds a 'stickiness' bonus to the previously chosen action at Stage 1,
    capturing the tendency to repeat choices regardless of outcome.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    perseverance: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the previously chosen action (can be negative).

    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Model-Free TD(0) (Stage-wise Learning)
This model differs from your previous TD(1) model by using TD(0) logic for the first stage. Instead of updating the first stage spaceship based on the *final reward*, it updates based on the value of the *state arrived at* (the Planet). This tests if the participant values the spaceship based on which planet it took them to, rather than just the coin they eventually got.

    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate.
