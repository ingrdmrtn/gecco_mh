Here are 3 new cognitive models for the two-step task. These models explore different mechanisms such as perseveration (stickiness), separate learning rates for positive/negative outcomes, and a mixture of model-based and model-free strategies with a weighting parameter.

### Model 1: Choice Perseveration (Stickiness) Model
This model adds a "stickiness" parameter (`phi`) to the standard Model-Free learning. This captures the tendency of participants to repeat their previous choice regardless of reward, a common phenomenon in reinforcement learning tasks.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseveration (Stickiness).
    
    Adds a 'stickiness' bonus to the previously chosen action at stage 1,
    capturing the tendency to repeat choices regardless of outcome.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    phi: [0, 5] stickiness parameter (positive = tendency to repeat, negative = tendency to switch).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, phi = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) 
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    # Track the previous action (initialize to -1 or handle first trial separately)
    last_action_1 = -1

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        
        # Calculate Q-values with stickiness bonus
        q_stage1_modified = q_stage1_mf.copy()
        if last_action_1 != -1:
            q_stage1_modified[last_action_1] += phi

        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_modified)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]

        state_idx = state[trial]

        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx, :])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # Standard SARSA/Q-learning updates
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # Eligibility trace-like update for stage 1 based on stage 2 RPE (common in these tasks)
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        last_action_1 = action_1[trial]

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Pos/Neg)
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (finding gold) versus negative outcomes (no gold). It uses two separate learning rates: `alpha_pos` for rewards and `alpha_neg` for non-rewards.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Asymmetric Learning Rates.
    
    Uses different learning rates for positive prediction errors (receiving reward)
    and negative prediction errors (omission of reward).
    
    Parameters:
    alpha_pos: [0, 1] learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    alpha_neg: [0, 1] learning rate for negative prediction errors.
    beta: [0, 10] inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    """
    alpha_pos, alpha_neg, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) 
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]

        state_idx = state[trial]

        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx, :])

        # Stage 1 Update
        # Note: In pure MF, the "reward" for stage 1 is the value of stage 2.
        # We calculate RPE first to determine which alpha to use.

        lr_1 = alpha_pos if delta_stage1 > 0 else alpha_neg
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += lr_1 * delta_stage1

        # Stage 2 Update
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        lr_2 = alpha_pos if delta_stage2 > 0 else alpha_neg
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += lr_2 * delta_stage2
        
        # Direct reinforcement of stage 1 choice by stage 2 reward (eligibility trace assumption with lambda=1)
        # Using the stage 2 RPE to update stage 1 value
        lr_trace = alpha_pos if delta_stage2 > 0 else alpha_neg
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += lr_trace * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (Daw et al. 2011)
This is the classic hybrid model that combines a Model-Based (planning) system with a Model-Free (habitual) system. A weighting parameter `w` determines the balance between the two systems during the first-stage choice.
