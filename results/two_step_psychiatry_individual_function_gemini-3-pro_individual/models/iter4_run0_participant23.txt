Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step decision task. These models explore different mechanisms such as perseverance (stickiness) at both stages, separate learning rates for the two stages (a common variation in reinforcement learning), and a hybrid model that mixes model-based and model-free values with a specific "eligibility trace" parameter.

### Model 1: Two-Stage Stickiness Model
This model hypothesizes that the participant has a tendency to repeat their previous choices at *both* stages, independent of the reward received. This "stickiness" or perseverance is a common heuristic in behavioral data. It introduces separate stickiness parameters for the first-stage choice (spaceship) and the second-stage choice (alien).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Stage-Specific Stickiness.
    Adds a 'bonus' to the action value of the previously chosen action at both stages.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    stick_1: [0,5] - Perseverance bonus for repeating the last stage 1 choice.
    stick_2: [0,5] - Perseverance bonus for repeating the last stage 2 choice (within state).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, stick_1, stick_2 = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1 = np.zeros(2)      
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2)) 
    
    # Track last choice for stickiness
    last_action_1 = -1
    last_action_2 = np.full(2, -1) # Track last action per state

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        q_net_1 = q_stage1.copy()
        if last_action_1 != -1:
            q_net_1[last_action_1] += stick_1
            
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net_1)

        r = reward[trial]

        # --- Updates ---
        # Update Stage 2 Q-values (SARSA-like update or Q-learning)
        # Standard Q-learning for stage 2
        delta_stage2 = r - q_stage2[state_idx, a2]
        q_stage2[state_idx, a2] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Dual Learning Rate Model (Stage 1 vs Stage 2)
This model posits that learning happens at different speeds for the high-level decision (which spaceship to pick) versus the low-level decision (which alien to ask). It separates the learning rate into `alpha_stage1` and `alpha_stage2`. This allows the model to capture behavior where a participant might rapidly change their alien preference but stick to a spaceship strategy for longer (or vice versa).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Separate Learning Rates for Stages.
    Allows for different plasticity in high-level (spaceship) vs low-level (alien) choices.

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Lambda (TD-Lambda)
This model implements a hybrid strategy where the first-stage values are a weighted mix of pure Model-Free (TD) updates and Model-Based evaluations. The parameter `w` controls the balance (0 = pure Model-Free, 1 = pure Model-Based). Crucially, it uses a simplified TD-lambda mechanism where the first stage update is driven directly by the reward, scaled by `lambda_reward`. This represents how much the final reward "punches through" directly to update the first stage, bypassing the second stage value estimate.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
