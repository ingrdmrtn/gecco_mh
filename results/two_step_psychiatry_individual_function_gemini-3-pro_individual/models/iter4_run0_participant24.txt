Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step decision task. These models explore different mechanisms of learning and choice, specifically focusing on perseveration, separate learning rates for different stages, and a hybrid model-based/model-free approach with eligibility traces.

### Model 1: Model-Free with Choice Perseveration
This model extends the basic Model-Free TD learning by adding a "perseveration" parameter. This captures the tendency of participants to repeat their previous first-stage choice regardless of the outcome, a common behavioral quirk in this task.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free TD Learning with Choice Perseveration (stickiness).
    Adds a bias to repeat the previous stage-1 choice.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    perseveration: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, perseveration = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) 
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) 
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    last_action_1 = -1 # Initialize with no previous action

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        # Calculate Q-values with stickiness bonus
        q_stage1_with_pers = q_stage1_mf.copy()
        if last_action_1 != -1:
            q_stage1_with_pers[last_action_1] += perseveration
            
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_with_pers)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        # Record this action for the next trial's perseveration
        last_action_1 = action_1[trial]

        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning ---
        # TD(0) update for Stage 1
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

        # TD(0) update for Stage 2
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free with Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda))
This model introduces an eligibility trace parameter (`lambda`). Instead of updating the first stage value based only on the second stage value (TD(0)), the reward received at the *end* of the trial directly influences the first stage choice, "tracing back" the credit. This bridges the gap between the final outcome and the initial decision more aggressively.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free TD(lambda) Learning.
    Uses eligibility traces to allow the final reward to directly update stage 1 values.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Softmax inverse temperature.
    lambda_param: [0, 1] - Eligibility trace decay (0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, lambda_param = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) 
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) 

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]

        # 2. Prediction error at stage 2 outcome

        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_2
        
        # Update Stage 1 Q-values:
        # It gets the immediate error (delta_1) PLUS a portion of the second stage error (delta_2)
        # mediated by lambda.
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * (delta_1 + lambda_param * delta_2)

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free with Mixing Parameter
This is the classic "Daw" hybrid model. It calculates two sets of Q-values for the first stage: one derived from direct experience (Model-Free) and one derived by combining the transition matrix with the second-stage values (Model-Based). A mixing weight `w` determines which system controls the decision.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
