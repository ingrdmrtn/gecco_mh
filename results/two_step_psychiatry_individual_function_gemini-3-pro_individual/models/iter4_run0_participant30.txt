Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates (Stage 1 vs. Stage 2)
This model hypothesizes that the participant might update their expectations about the spaceships (Stage 1) at a different speed than they update their expectations about the aliens (Stage 2). It combines Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) values using a mixing weight `w`, but crucially, it separates the learning rates for the two stages.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates (Stage 1 vs. Stage 2).
    
    This model assumes the agent learns about the value of spaceships (Stage 1)
    at a different rate than the value of aliens (Stage 2). It mixes model-based 
    and model-free values for the first decision.

    Parameters:
    lr_stage1: [0,1] - Learning rate for stage 1 (spaceship) updates.
    lr_stage2: [0,1] - Learning rate for stage 2 (alien) updates.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    lr_stage1, lr_stage2, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

        # as the target for the first stage update.
        # Often simplified to just re-using the reward if lambda=1, but here we do simple TD(0)

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free with Perseverance
This model abandons the Model-Based component entirely to test if the participant relies solely on cached values (Model-Free). However, it adds a "perseverance" parameter (`pers`). This captures the tendency to repeat the last chosen action (or avoid it) regardless of the reward outcome, a common behavioral heuristic.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free with Choice Perseverance.
    
    This model assumes no knowledge of the transition structure (Pure MF).
    It includes a perseverance bonus that biases the agent to repeat 
    the previously chosen spaceship, independent of reward history.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Learning rate for Q-value updates.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    pers: [0,1] - Perseverance bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.

### Model 3: Model-Based with Forgetting (Decay)
This model is a variation of the pure Model-Based learner. It posits that while the agent calculates values based on the transition structure, the learned values of the aliens (Stage 2 Q-values) decay toward a neutral point (0) over time if they are not visited. This "forgetting" mechanism helps handle non-stationary environments where unvisited options might change value.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based with Passive Forgetting (Decay).
    
    This model relies on the transition matrix (MB). However, Q-values for 
    the second stage (aliens) decay towards 0 on every trial by a factor 
    (1 - decay_rate). This simulates forgetting or uncertainty growth for 
    unvisited options.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for visited states.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    decay_rate: [0,1] - Rate at which Q-values decay toward 0 (0=no decay, 1=instant forget).
