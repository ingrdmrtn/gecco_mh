Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task structure, exploring different parameter combinations and mechanisms not yet fully covered in the "tried so far" list.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns at different speeds for the high-level spaceship choice (Stage 1) versus the low-level alien choice (Stage 2). This is biologically plausible as Stage 1 involves abstract planning or habit formation, while Stage 2 is direct stimulus-response reinforcement.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates.
    
    This model assumes the participant uses a hybrid of Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) 
    strategies, but critically, updates their value estimates with different learning rates 
    for the first stage (spaceship choice) and the second stage (alien choice).
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_stage1: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1 (Spaceship) Q-values.
    - alpha_stage2: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 (Alien) Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choices.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter mixing Model-Based (1) and Model-Free (0) values at Stage 1.

    # Transition matrix: A->X (0->0) is 0.7, A->Y (0->1) is 0.3, etc.
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # MF Values for Spaceship A vs U
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Values for Aliens (Planet X: W, S; Planet Y: P, H)

```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free with "Stickiness" (Choice Autocorrelation)
While previous models looked at "perseveration" as a simple bonus, this model implements "stickiness" as a decaying trace of past actions (autocorrelation). Instead of just repeating the *last* choice, the agent builds up a habit strength for specific choices over time that decays slowly. This captures inertia more robustly than a simple 1-back check.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Q-Learning with Choice Trace Stickiness.
    
    This model assumes the participant is purely model-free but builds up a 'habit' 
    or 'stickiness' for actions. Unlike simple perseveration (1-back), this uses a 
    decaying trace of past choices to bias current selection.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - stickiness_decay: [0, 1] How fast the choice trace decays (0=instant, 1=never forgets).
    - stickiness_weight: [0, 5] How strongly the choice trace influences the decision.

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Distinct Reward Sensitivities (Win vs. Loss)
This model investigates if the participant reacts differently to rewards (getting a coin) versus omissions (getting nothing). While `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg` have been tried, this formulation keeps a single learning rate `alpha` but introduces a `reward_sensitivity` scalar specifically for the *magnitude* of the reward signal itself. This separates the speed of updating (alpha) from the subjective valuation of the outcome (sensitivity).

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Reward Sensitivity Scaling.
    
    This model separates the learning rate (how fast old info is overwritten) from 
    reward sensitivity (how much a reward 'matters'). This allows the model to capture 
    participants who might learn slowly but react very strongly to rewards when they occur.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Model-Based (1) vs Model-Free (0) weight.
    - sensitivity: [0, 10] Scalar multiplier for the reward signal (subjective utility).
