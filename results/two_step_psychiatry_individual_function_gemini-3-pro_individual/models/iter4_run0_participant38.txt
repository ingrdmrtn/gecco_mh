Here are 3 new cognitive models that introduce mechanisms distinct from the combinations listed in the feedback (such as choice perseveration, asymmetric learning rates, and stage-specific learning rates).

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Choice Perseveration.
    
    This model combines Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habit) values 
    using a weighting parameter 'w'. Crucially, it adds a 'perseveration' 
    parameter, which captures the tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 
    choice regardless of reward (stickiness).

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate for updating Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] - Weight between MB (1) and MF (0) control.
    perseveration: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the logit of the previously chosen action.
