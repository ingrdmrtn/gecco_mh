Here are three new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms than the ones you've already tried.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates
This model implements the classic hybrid reinforcement learning theory (Daw et al., 2011), combining Model-Based (planning using the transition matrix) and Model-Free (TD learning) systems. Crucially, it uses **separate learning rates** for the first stage (spaceship choice) and the second stage (alien choice), allowing the agent to update values at different speeds depending on the stage of the task.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Separate Stage Learning Rates.
    Combines Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) learning.

    Bounds:
    lr_stage1: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Stage 1 Q-values.
    lr_stage2: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Stage 2 Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] - Mixing weight (0 = pure MF, 1 = pure MB).
    """
    lr_stage1, lr_stage2, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix (70% common, 30% rare)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

        # Q_MB = Transition_Matrix * V(state)

```

### Model 2: Model-Free Learner with Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda))
This model is purely Model-Free but uses an **eligibility trace** parameter ($\lambda$). Unlike the standard TD(0) learner which only updates the first stage based on the second stage's value estimate, a TD($\lambda$) agent allows the reward received at the *end* of the trial to directly influence the value of the *first* choice (spaceship), bypassing the second stage value estimate to some degree.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 2: Model-Free TD(lambda) Learner.
    Uses eligibility traces to allow the final reward to directly update 
    the Stage 1 choice, bridging the gap between action 1 and reward.

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive vs Negative)
This model investigates if the participant learns differently from wins (rewards = 1) versus losses (rewards = 0). It splits the learning rate into $\alpha_{pos}$ and $\alpha_{neg}$. This captures "optimism" (ignoring bad news) or "pessimism" (ignoring good news) biases often seen in psychiatric populations.
