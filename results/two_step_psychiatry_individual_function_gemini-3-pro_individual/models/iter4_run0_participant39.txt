Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task structure. These models explore different mechanisms for learning and decision-making, specifically focusing on how values are updated and how different systems (Model-Based vs. Model-Free) might interact or be parameterized differently.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates for Stages
This model hypothesizes that the participant might learn at different speeds for the first-stage decision (which spaceship to pick) versus the second-stage decision (which alien to ask). This is often relevant because the first stage is about navigation and planning, while the second stage is about direct reward association.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates.
    
    This model combines Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) value estimation.
    It uses distinct learning rates for Stage 1 (navigation) and Stage 2 (reward).
    
    Parameters:
    lr_stage1: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Stage 1 MF values.
    lr_stage2: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Stage 2 MF values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).

```

### Model 2: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive vs Negative RPE)
This model investigates if the participant learns differently from positive surprises (getting more gold than expected) versus negative surprises (getting less). This asymmetry is a common finding in reinforcement learning tasks related to dopamine signaling.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):

    alpha_pos: [0, 1] - Learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    alpha_neg: [0, 1] - Learning rate for negative prediction errors.

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Inverse Temperature Decay
This model tests the hypothesis that the participant's exploration decreases over time. Initially, they might explore randomly (low beta), but as they gather information, they become more deterministic (high beta). This is modeled by a `beta` that grows (or an inverse temperature that decays) or simply separate betas for early vs late, but here we implement separate betas for stage 1 and stage 2 to capture different levels of stochasticity in navigation vs harvesting.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
