Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2
This model posits that learning might happen at different speeds for the first-stage choice (which is more abstract and distal from the reward) versus the second-stage choice (which is proximal to the reward). It combines model-based and model-free values with a weighting parameter `w`.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid model with separate learning rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2.

    alpha_stage1: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Stage 1 (Model-Free).
    alpha_stage2: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Stage 2 (Model-Free).
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] - Mixing weight (0 = pure MF, 1 = pure MB).
    """
    alpha_stage1, alpha_stage2, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Transition matrix assumed fixed/known: A->X (0.7), U->Y (0.7)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

### Model 2: Model-Based Learner with Transition Learning
Instead of assuming the transition matrix is fixed at [0.7, 0.3], this model learns the transition probabilities between spaceships and planets dynamically. It is a pure Model-Based agent (w=1 implicitly) that updates its internal model of the world structure.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    transition_lr: [0, 1] - Learning rate for updating transition probabilities.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, transition_lr = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Initialize transition matrix estimates (start uniform 0.5/0.5)

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Reward Asymmetry
This model investigates if the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (rewards) versus negative outcomes (omissions). It splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg` but keeps a single mixing weight `w` for the hybrid strategy.

import numpy as np
