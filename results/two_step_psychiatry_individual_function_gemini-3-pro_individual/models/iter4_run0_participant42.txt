Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Distinct 1st/2nd Stage Learning Rates
This model relaxes the assumption that learning happens at the same speed for the first-stage (spaceship choice) and the second-stage (alien choice). It introduces separate learning rates (`alpha1`, `alpha2`) for the two stages, combined with a hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free weighting parameter `w`.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Split Learning Rates.
    
    Distinguishes between how quickly the agent updates values for the first-stage
    (spaceship) choices versus the second-stage (alien) choices.
    
    Bounds:
    - alpha1: [0, 1] Learning rate for stage 1 (MF) values.
    - alpha2: [0, 1] Learning rate for stage 2 values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (1=MB, 0=MF).
    """
    alpha1, alpha2, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Model-Based Value
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Hybrid Value
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Updates ---
        # Stage 1 MF update (using alpha1)
        # Note: Standard TD(0) or similar often uses the value of the state reached.
        # Here we use the value of the chosen action in the next state.
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += alpha1 * delta_stage1
        
        # Stage 2 update (using alpha2)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += alpha2 * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free with Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda))
This model abandons the Model-Based component entirely to focus on a more sophisticated Model-Free mechanism. It uses an eligibility trace parameter `lambda_param` to allow the second-stage reward to directly influence the first-stage choice update, rather than just updating the first stage based on the second-stage value estimate.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Learner with Eligibility Traces (TD-Lambda).
    
    Uses an eligibility trace to bridge the credit assignment between the reward 
    obtained at the end of the trial and the first-stage choice.
    
    Bounds:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1]
    - beta: [0, 10]
    - lambda_param: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay parameter (0=TD(0), 1=Monte Carlo).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, lambda_param = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # No transition matrix needed for pure MF
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Policy (Pure MF) ---

        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

        # 2. Prediction error at stage 2 (driven by reward)
        delta_2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]

        # Update Stage 1 Q-value
        # It gets updated by its own error (delta_1) PLUS a portion of the stage 2 error (delta_2)
        # mediated by lambda.
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * (delta_1 + lambda_param * delta_2)
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Reward-Dependent Learning Rates
This model posits that the participant might learn differently from successes (rewards) than from failures (omissions). It splits the learning rate into `alpha_rew` (used when reward=1) and `alpha_unrew` (used when reward=0). This asymmetry is a common finding in reinforcement learning tasks. It retains the hybrid `w` parameter.

    or negative (no reward).

    - alpha_unrew: [0, 1] Learning rate when no reward is received.
