Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task structure, exploring different mechanisms like model-based learning, perseverance, and separate learning rates for positive and negative outcomes.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (MB/MF)
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It posits that participants use a mixture of two strategies: a Model-Free (MF) strategy that learns from direct experience (TD learning) and a Model-Based (MB) strategy that uses the known transition structure (70/30) to compute values. A mixing weight `w` determines the balance between these two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Model.
    
    Combines a Model-Free (TD) learner with a Model-Based learner that uses the 
    transition matrix to calculate expected values. A mixing parameter 'w' 
    controls the contribution of each system to the final Stage 1 choice.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for Q-value updates.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    
    # Transition matrix: A->X (0->0) is 0.7, U->Y (1->1) is 0.7
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # MF values for Stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # MF values for Stage 2 (aliens)
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Model-Based Value Calculation
        # Max value at stage 2 for each state
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1) 
        # Bellman equation using the transition model
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Updates ---
        # 1. Update Stage 1 MF value (TD(0))
        # Note: In the full Daw model, this is often TD(lambda), but simple TD is used here for constraint compliance.
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free with Choice Perseverance
This model assumes a pure model-free learning mechanism (like your previous best model) but adds a "perseverance" parameter `p`. This parameter captures the tendency to repeat the previous action (or switch away from it) at Stage 1, regardless of the reward outcome. This is a common heuristic in human and animal behavior.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free RL with Choice Perseverance (Stickiness).
    
    Standard TD learning model augmented with a 'perseverance' bonus. 
    If the agent chose option A on the last trial, option A gets a value boost 
    (or penalty) on the current trial, independent of reward history.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate for Q-value updates.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    perseverance: [0, 5] Bonus added to the previously chosen action (0 = no stickiness).

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))

```

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive/Negative)
This model investigates whether the participant learns differently from success (getting a coin) versus failure (getting zero). It splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` (for rewards > 0) and `alpha_neg` (for 0 rewards). This asymmetry is often observed in clinical populations or specific cognitive phenotypes.

    and negative prediction errors (worse than expected).
