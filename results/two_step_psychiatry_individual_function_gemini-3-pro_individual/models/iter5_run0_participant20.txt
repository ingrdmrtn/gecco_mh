Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task, exploring different mechanisms than the ones previously tried (standard hybrid, perseveration, split learning rates, and eligibility traces).

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Separate Learning Rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns the value of the spaceships (Stage 1) at a different rate than they learn the value of the aliens (Stage 2). The first stage involves abstract transition structures, while the second stage is a direct bandit task.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free RL with Separate Stage Learning Rates.
    
    This model allows for different plasticity in the two stages of the task. 
    It posits that learning the value of the first-step actions (spaceships) might 
    occur at a different speed than learning the value of the second-step actions (aliens),
    perhaps due to the difference in temporal proximity to the reward.

    Parameters:
    lr_stage1: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1 (Spaceships).
    lr_stage2: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 (Aliens).
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control (1 = Pure MB, 0 = Pure MF).
    """
    lr_stage1, lr_stage2, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)       
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        # Weighted combination of MB and MF values
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf

        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Updates ---
        # Update Stage 1 MF value using lr_stage1
        # We use the value of the state reached (q_stage2_mf) as the target (SARSA-like logic here for TD(0))
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += lr_stage1 * delta_stage1

        # Update Stage 2 MF value using lr_stage2
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += lr_stage2 * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Based with Forgetting
This model removes the Model-Free component entirely (`w` is implicitly 1.0) to focus on a pure planning strategy, but introduces a "forgetting" parameter. This assumes the participant builds a model of the world but their memory of the specific reward values for the aliens decays over time toward a neutral value (0.5), representing uncertainty or memory loss.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values based on reward.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    decay_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which unchosen Q-values decay to 0.5.

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Reward-Dependent Learning Rates
This model investigates if the participant learns differently from success (positive reward) versus failure (zero reward). Unlike the "alpha_pos/alpha_neg" combination previously tried which usually splits based on prediction error sign, this model specifically splits based on the *outcome* itself (did I get a coin or not?), which is a distinct psychological heuristic often seen in clinical populations.

    """

    This model separates the learning rate based on whether a reward was received (1)
    or not (0). This captures potential asymmetries in how the agent processes 
    gains versus lack of gains (e.g., optimism bias or pessimism).

    Parameters:
    lr_reward: [0, 1] Learning rate when reward is 1.
    lr_no_reward: [0, 1] Learning rate when reward is 0.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
