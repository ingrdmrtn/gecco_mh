Here are three cognitive models for the two-step decision-making task, building upon the feedback and the task structure.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Learner
This model assumes the participant builds a mental model of the task structure (the transition probabilities) and uses this to plan their first-stage choices. Unlike the Model-Free learner in your feedback, this agent calculates the value of a spaceship by explicitly weighting the values of the planets by the transition probabilities.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Learner.
    
    This model calculates the value of Stage 1 actions (spaceships) by combining
    the learned values of Stage 2 states (planets) with the known transition matrix.
    It does not rely on a cached Stage 1 Q-value updated via TD error.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Rate at which Stage 2 Q-values are updated based on reward.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.

    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Fixed transition matrix as per task description (70% common, 30% rare)

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

        # --- Learning ---
        # Only Stage 2 Q-values are updated directly from reward
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Learner (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This is the classic "Two-Step" model often used in psychiatry research. It assumes the participant's brain computes both a habitual (Model-Free) value and a planned (Model-Based) value for the first stage, and the final decision is a weighted combination of both. This allows capturing behavior that is sensitive to reward but perhaps insensitive to transition structure (or vice versa).

import numpy as np

### Model 3: Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseverance
This model extends the simple Model-Free learner (TD(0)) by adding a "perseverance" bonus. Participants often have a tendency to repeat their previous choice regardless of reward (stickiness). This model captures that heuristic, which is distinct from reinforcement learning.

```python
import numpy as np

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
    perseverance: [0,5] Bonus added to the log-odds of repeating the previous Stage 1 choice.
