Here are three new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms and parameter combinations not yet fully tested in the provided history.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Eligibility Traces (TD($\lambda$))
This model introduces an eligibility trace parameter (`lambda_eligibility`). Instead of just updating the first-stage value based on the second-stage value (standard TD(0)), this model allows the reward received at the second stage to directly influence the first-stage update, scaled by lambda. This bridges the gap between the two stages more effectively than simple one-step updates.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF Model with Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda)).
    
    Uses an eligibility trace to allow the Stage 2 reward to directly update 
    Stage 1 values, rather than relying solely on the Stage 2 value estimate.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = pure Model-Free, 1 = pure Model-Based).
    lambda_eligibility: [0, 1] - Decay rate of eligibility traces (0=TD(0), 1=Monte Carlo).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w, lambda_eligibility = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Updates ---
        # 1. Prediction error at stage 1 (based on stage 2 value)
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # 2. Prediction error at stage 2 (based on reward)

        # 3. Eligibility trace update: Propagate stage 2 error back to stage 1
        # This effectively updates Q1 based on the actual reward received
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * lambda_eligibility * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free with Separate Learning Rates for First and Second Stages
This model abandons the model-based component (`w=0` implicitly) to focus purely on model-free dynamics, but it hypothesizes that learning happens at different speeds for the high-level spaceship choice (Stage 1) versus the specific alien choice (Stage 2). It also includes a perseveration parameter to capture habit.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Model with Stage-Specific Learning Rates and Perseveration.
    
    Assumes no model-based planning (w=0), but allows for different plasticity
    at the two levels of the hierarchy, plus a tendency to repeat stage 1 choices.

    Parameters:
    lr_stage1: [0, 1] - Learning rate for spaceship choices.
    lr_stage2: [0, 1] - Learning rate for alien choices.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    perseveration: [0, 5] - Bonus for repeating the previous Stage 1 action.

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Reward-Dependent Learning Rates
This model tests the hypothesis that the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (wins) versus negative outcomes (losses/omissions). It applies separate learning rates (`alpha_pos`, `alpha_neg`) to the *second stage* updates (where the reward is received), while keeping a standard hybrid structure.

    stage is positive (better than expected) or negative (worse than expected).
    
    Parameters:
    alpha_pos: [0, 1] - Learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    alpha_neg: [0, 1] - Learning rate for negative prediction errors.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
