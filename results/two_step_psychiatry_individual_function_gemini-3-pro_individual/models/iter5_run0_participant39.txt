Here are three new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task, distinct from the parameter combinations already tried.

### Model 1: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive vs. Negative Prediction Errors)
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (winning gold) versus negative outcomes (getting nothing). This asymmetry is a common finding in reinforcement learning, where organisms may update their expectations more aggressively after a reward than after an omission (or vice versa).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: Model-Free Learner with Asymmetric Learning Rates.
    This model splits the learning rate into two separate parameters:
    one for positive prediction errors (rewards) and one for negative
    prediction errors (omissions).
    
    Bounds:
    alpha_pos: [0, 1] - Learning rate for positive prediction errors (RPE > 0).
    alpha_neg: [0, 1] - Learning rate for negative prediction errors (RPE < 0).
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    """
    alpha_pos, alpha_neg, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Initialize Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) 
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # 2 states (planets), 2 actions (aliens)
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial]
        a1 = action_1[trial]

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)

        if delta_stage2 >= 0:
            q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] += alpha_pos * delta_stage2
        else:
            q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] += alpha_neg * delta_stage2

        # Stage 1 Update (TD Error based on Stage 2 Q-value)
        # Note: We use the updated Stage 2 value as the target
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] - q_stage1_mf[a1]
        
        # We apply the same asymmetry logic to the Stage 1 TD error
        if delta_stage1 >= 0:
            q_stage1_mf[a1] += alpha_pos * delta_stage1
        else:
            q_stage1_mf[a1] += alpha_neg * delta_stage1
        
    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Decay-Based Reinforcement Learning
Standard Q-learning assumes values stay constant until the state is visited again. This model introduces a "forgetting" or "decay" parameter. On every trial, the values of unchosen actions (and unvisited states) decay slowly toward zero (or a baseline). This captures the cognitive reality that memory of specific reward probabilities fades over time if not refreshed.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 2: Model-Free Learner with Passive Value Decay.
    Action values for unchosen options decay toward 0 on every trial.
    This simulates forgetting or uncertainty growth over time.
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Standard learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    decay_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which unchosen Q-values decay (1 = no decay, 0 = instant forgetting).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, decay_rate = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

### Model 3: Pure Model-Based with Exploration Bonus
This model abandons the hybrid approach and tests a pure Model-Based strategy, but adds an "exploration bonus" parameter. Instead of just calculating expected value based on the transition matrix, the agent adds a bonus to options that have been visited less frequently recently (or simply a fixed bonus for the 'other' option), though here we implement it simply as a fixed bias towards the option with higher uncertainty or lower current value, effectively modeled as an inverse-perseveration or novelty seeking. To keep parameters under 5 and distinct, we implement a 'novelty' bonus for switching actions at stage 1.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 3: Pure Model-Based Learner with Novelty Bonus (Switching Bonus).

    encouraging exploration.
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - For updating Stage 2 Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
