Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step task, exploring different mechanisms for learning and decision-making.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (Standard Daw Model)
This model implements the classic hypothesis for this task: participants use a mixture of Model-Based (planning using the transition matrix) and Model-Free (TD learning) strategies. A weighting parameter `w` controls the balance between these two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning.
    
    This model assumes the participant's stage 1 choice is a weighted combination
    of Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) values.
    - MB values are calculated by planning: Transition_Matrix * Max_Stage2_Values.
    - MF values are learned via TD prediction errors.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values (alpha).
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Model-free values for aliens (planets x aliens)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Decision ---

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free with Eligibility Traces (TD-Lambda)
This model tests the hypothesis that participants don't explicitly "plan" (Model-Based), but instead use a more sophisticated Model-Free mechanism called eligibility traces. This allows the reward at the end of the trial to directly reinforce the first-stage choice (Spaceship), skipping the intermediate state value, effectively "smearing" the reward back in time.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Eligibility Traces (TD-Lambda).
    
    Instead of just updating the previous step, this model allows the final reward
    to directly influence the value of the Stage 1 choice via an eligibility trace parameter (lambda).
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Alpha.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    lam: [0,1] - Eligibility trace decay parameter (lambda).

```

### Model 3: Model-Free with Choice Perseveration
This model is a pure Model-Free learner (like the template TD-0), but it adds a "perseveration" bonus. This tests the hypothesis that the participant has a tendency to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice (Spaceship A or U) regardless of whether they were rewarded, simply out of habit or motor repetition.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):

    Adds a 'stickiness' parameter. If the participant chose Spaceship A on trial t-1,
    Spaceship A gets a value bonus on trial t, regardless of reward history.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Alpha.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    perseveration: [0,5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
