Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task. These models move beyond the pure Model-Free baseline provided in the feedback by introducing Model-Based learning, perseveration, and separate learning rates.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (MB/MF)
This model combines model-free learning (TD learning) with model-based planning. The agent computes values for the first stage by mixing the stored Q-values (MF) with values calculated using the known transition matrix and the second-stage values (MB). A mixing parameter `w` controls the balance between these two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    Combines direct reinforcement learning (MF) with a planning module (MB) that
    uses the transition structure of the task.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] Weight parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).

    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition structure: A->X (0->0) is 0.7, U->Y (1->1) is 0.7
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

        # TD(1) / SARSA-like update for Stage 1 MF (using actual stage 2 value)
        # Note: Often in hybrid models, stage 1 MF is updated via lambda-return or direct TD.

```

### Model 2: Model-Free with Choice Perseveration
This model is a pure reinforcement learner (like the baseline) but adds a "perseveration" parameter `p`. This parameter captures the tendency to repeat (or switch from) the previously chosen action at the first stage, regardless of reward history. This is a common heuristic observed in human decision-making.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free RL with Choice Perseveration (Stickiness).
    
    Adds a bias to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice, independent of reward.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    perseveration: [0, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.

### Model 3: Hybrid MB/MF with Separate Learning Rates
This model refines the hybrid hypothesis by allowing different learning rates for the first and second stages. It is possible that the participant updates their estimates of alien rewards (`alpha2`) at a different speed than they update their cached values of the spaceships (`alpha1`). This captures the idea that learning the immediate reward structure might happen faster or slower than propagating those values back to the start state.

    Parameters:
    alpha1: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1 (Spaceships).
    alpha2: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 (Aliens).
