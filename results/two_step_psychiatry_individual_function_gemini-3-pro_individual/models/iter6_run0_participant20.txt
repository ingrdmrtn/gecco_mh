Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task, formulated as Python functions.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Separate Stage Betas and Perseveration
This model extends the "best model" (Hybrid + Perseveration) by introducing separate inverse temperature parameters (`beta`) for Stage 1 and Stage 2. This accounts for the possibility that the participant's noise/exploration levels differ between the high-level spaceship choice (Stage 1) and the low-level alien choice (Stage 2).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Separate Stage Betas and Perseveration.
    
    Combines Model-Free and Model-Based learning with choice stickiness (perseveration).
    Crucially, it uses distinct inverse temperature (beta) parameters for the two stages,
    allowing for different levels of decision noise/exploration at each step.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta_1: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for Stage 1 choice.
    beta_2: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for Stage 2 choice.
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    perseveration: [0,1] - Bonus added to the previously chosen Stage 1 action.
    """
    learning_rate, beta_1, beta_2, w, perseveration = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    last_action_1 = -1

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        q_hybrid = (w * q_stage1_mb) + ((1 - w) * q_stage1_mf)
        
        # Add perseveration bonus
        pers_bonus = np.zeros(2)
        if last_action_1 != -1:

        # policy for the second choice
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta_2 * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)

        # ACTION VALUE UPDATING FOR CHOICE 2
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free TD(lambda) Learner with Perseveration
This model assumes the participant does *not* use a model-based map (no `w` or transition matrix logic). Instead, it uses an eligibility trace parameter (`lam`) to connect the Stage 2 outcome directly to the Stage 1 choice. It also includes `perseveration` to capture the tendency to repeat Stage 1 choices regardless of value.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free TD(lambda) Learner with Perseveration.
    
    A pure model-free agent that updates Stage 1 values based on both the
    Stage 2 state value (TD(0)) and the final reward (TD(1) via eligibility trace).
    Includes a perseveration bonus for choice stickiness.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    lam: [0,1] - Eligibility trace parameter (0 = update Stage 1 only on State 2 value; 1 = update Stage 1 fully on Reward).
    perseveration: [0,1] - Bonus added to the previously chosen Stage 1 action.

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rate (Dual Alpha) Model-Free Learner with Perseveration
This model tests the hypothesis that the participant learns differently from positive prediction errors (better than expected) versus negative prediction errors (worse than expected). It is a pure Model-Free agent with choice stickiness.

    alpha_neg: [0,1] - Learning rate when prediction error is negative.
