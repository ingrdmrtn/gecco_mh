Here are three cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (Classic Daw et al. 2011)
This model implements the canonical hybrid theory where decision-making is a weighted combination of Model-Based (planning using the transition matrix) and Model-Free (TD learning) valuations.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    This model combines two valuation systems:
    1. Model-Based (MB): Computes values by planning through the transition matrix.
    2. Model-Free (MF): Learns values directly from experience using TD errors.
    
    The final choice at Stage 1 is a weighted mixture of both systems.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which MF Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).

    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Fixed transition matrix: A->X (0->0) is 0.7, U->Y (1->1) is 0.7
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # MF Values for Spaceship A (0) and U (1)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Values for Aliens on Planet X (0) and Y (1)
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- STAGE 1 CHOICE ---
        
        # Model-Based Valuation: V_MB(s1) = T * max(Q_s2)
        # We use the MF Q-values at stage 2 as the terminal values for the MB planner

        # Stage 1 TD Error (SARSA-style for the transition)
        # Note: In the canonical Daw model, stage 1 MF values are updated by the best stage 2 value (Q-learning)
        # or the value of the state chosen. Here we use the value of the state chosen (SARSA(0)).
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free with Eligibility Traces (TD($\lambda$))
This model assumes the participant is purely Model-Free but uses eligibility traces to connect the final reward back to the first stage choice more efficiently than simple one-step TD learning. This allows the reward at stage 2 to directly influence the value of the spaceship chosen at stage 1.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Eligibility Traces (TD-Lambda).
    
    Instead of just updating the immediately preceding state, this model uses
    an eligibility trace parameter (lambda) to update the Stage 1 choice based 
    on the Stage 2 reward directly.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    lambda_param: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay (0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo).

### Model 3: Choice Perseveration Model
This model adds a "perseveration" bias to the standard reinforcement learning framework. It posits that participants have a tendency to repeat (or switch from) their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of the reward outcome, capturing simple motor or cognitive inertia often seen in behavioral data.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free RL with Choice Perseveration.
    
    This model adds a 'stickiness' parameter to the Stage 1 choice. 
    It tracks the previous choice and adds a bonus (or penalty) to the 
    Q-value of that action on the next trial.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    perseveration: [0, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
