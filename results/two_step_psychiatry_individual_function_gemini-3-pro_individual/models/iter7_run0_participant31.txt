Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step decision task. They build upon the feedback by introducing model-based planning, perseverance (habit), and separate learning rates for different stages.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This model combines model-free learning (TD) with model-based planning. The agent maintains Q-values learned from experience but also computes values by projecting future rewards using the known transition structure of the task (70/30). A weighting parameter `w` determines the balance between these two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner.
    
    The agent computes Stage 1 values as a weighted sum of Model-Based (MB) 
    planning and Model-Free (MF) caching.
    MB values are calculated using the fixed transition matrix and max Stage 2 values.
    MF values are updated via TD learning.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature (softness of choice).
    w: [0,1] Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Fixed transition probabilities as described in task: A->X (0.7), U->Y (0.7)
    # Row 0 (A): [0.7 to X, 0.3 to Y], Row 1 (U): [0.3 to X, 0.7 to Y]
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) 

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Decision ---
        # Model-Based Value Calculation
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1) # Best value available on each planet
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Hybrid Value
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial] 

        # --- Stage 2 Decision ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning ---
        # Update Stage 1 MF value using the value of the state actually reached
        # (This is the standard TD(0) update for the MF component)
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

        # Update Stage 2 MF value based on reward
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseverance
This extends the basic Model-Free learner by adding a "perseverance" (or stickiness) parameter. This captures the tendency of participants to repeat their previous choice regardless of reward, a common habitual bias in this task.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseverance.
    
    Standard TD learning, but the Stage 1 choice probability is biased by 
    what was chosen on the immediately preceding trial.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
    perseverance: [0,5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, perseverance = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    last_action_1 = -1 # Indicator for no previous action

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Decision ---
        # Add perseverance bonus to the Q-values temporarily for decision making
        q_stage1_effective = q_stage1_mf.copy()
        if last_action_1 != -1:
            q_stage1_effective[last_action_1] += perseverance

        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_effective)

        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning ---
        # Note: Perseverance does not affect the learning update, only the policy
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Distinct Learning Rates
This model refines the Hybrid learner by acknowledging that learning about the immediate reward (Stage 2) might happen at a different speed than learning the value of the spaceship (Stage 1). It uses separate learning rates for the two stages.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Distinct Stage Learning Rates.
    
    Similar to the Hybrid model, but allows the second stage (Alien choice) 
    to be updated at a different rate than the first stage (Spaceship choice).
    This can capture if an agent updates values quickly after seeing a coin 
    but slowly propagates that value back to the start.

    Parameters:
    lr_1: [0,1] Learning rate for Stage 1 (Spaceships).
    lr_2: [0,1] Learning rate for Stage 2 (Aliens).

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
