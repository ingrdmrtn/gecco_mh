Here are three new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms than those previously tried.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Loss Sensitivity
This model hypothesizes that the participant does not view "0 coins" merely as a lack of reward, but as an explicit loss or punishment. It introduces a `loss_sensitivity` parameter. When the reward is 0, the model treats it as a negative value (e.g., -0.5), which drives avoidance behavior more strongly than standard extinction.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Loss Sensitivity.
    
    Standard models treat Reward=0 as neutral. This model assumes 'loss aversion' 
    or negative utility for empty boxes. If reward is 0, the effective utility 
    is -1 * loss_sensitivity.
    
    Bounds:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1]
    - beta: [0, 10]
    - w: [0, 1]
    - loss_sensitivity: [0, 5] (Magnitude of negative utility for 0 coins)
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w, loss_sensitivity = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf

            effective_reward = 1.0
        else:

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))

```

### Model 2: Hybrid Learner with Dynamic Transition Learning
Standard models assume the participant knows the transition matrix (70%/30%) perfectly and statically. This model assumes the participant is *learning* the transition structure over time. It uses a separate learning rate (`lr_transition`) to update the estimated transition probabilities based on observed state transitions, which then feeds into the Model-Based calculation.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    they learn the transition probability (p_common) trial-by-trial.

```

### Model 3: Pure Model-Free with Dual Learning Rates and Eligibility
This model removes the Model-Based component entirely (`w` is effectively 0) to test a pure reinforcement learning hypothesis. However, it adds complexity to the Model-Free system by allowing different plasticity (learning rates) for the abstract Stage 1 (Spaceships) versus the concrete Stage 2 (Aliens), and connects them via an eligibility trace (`lambda`). This tests if the participant is a sophisticated Model-Free learner rather than a planner.

```python
