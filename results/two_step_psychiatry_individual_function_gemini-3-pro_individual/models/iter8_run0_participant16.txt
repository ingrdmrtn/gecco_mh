Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task structure, exploring different mechanisms for value updating and choice persistence.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Eligibility Traces (TD($\lambda$))
This model implements the classic hybrid theory where behavior is a mix of Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) learning. Crucially, it uses an eligibility trace parameter (`lambda_param`) to control how much the first-stage Model-Free values are updated by the second-stage value versus the final reward.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free learner with Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda)).
    
    This model combines a Model-Based controller (which uses the transition matrix)
    and a Model-Free controller. The 'w' parameter arbitrates between them.
    The 'lambda_param' determines if Stage 1 MF values are updated by Stage 2 values (TD(0))
    or the final reward (TD(1)).

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    lambda_param: [0, 1] - Eligibility trace (0 = update from next state value, 1 = update from reward).
    """

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Model-free values for aliens
    
    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Decision ---
        # Model-Based Value Calculation: V(state) = sum(P(s'|s,a) * max(Q(s', a')))
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial] # Actual planet arrived at

        # --- Stage 2 Decision ---
        # Only Model-Free values exist here (terminal states are rewards)
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)

        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # 2. Prediction Error at Stage 1
        # This is the difference between the value of the state we arrived at (Q_stage2)

        # Update = alpha * (delta_stage1 + lambda * delta_stage2)
        # If lambda=0, we only care about the step to the planet.
        # If lambda=1, we pass the reward error all the way back.
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * (delta_stage1 + lambda_param * delta_stage2)

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss

### Model 2: Model-Free Learning with Choice Stickiness
This model posits that the participant is purely Model-Free (ignoring the transition structure) but exhibits "stickiness" (perseveration). They have a tendency to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of the outcome, captured by a `stickiness` parameter. This is often a strong confound in this task.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Choice Stickiness.
    
    This model ignores the transition structure (Pure MF) but adds a 
    perseveration bonus to the previously chosen action at Stage 1.
    It uses simple TD(1) learning (updating from reward).

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    stickiness: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive vs Negative RPE)
This model investigates whether the participant learns differently from positive surprises (getting a coin) versus negative surprises (getting nothing). It splits the `learning_rate` into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`. It assumes a pure Model-Free framework to isolate the learning rate asymmetry effect.

```python

    and negative prediction errors (alpha_neg). This tests if the agent updates
    values differently when disappointed vs. rewarded.

    alpha_pos: [0, 1] - Learning rate for positive Prediction Errors (RPE > 0).
    alpha_neg: [0, 1] - Learning rate for negative Prediction Errors (RPE < 0).
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
