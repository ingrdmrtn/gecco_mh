Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task, exploring different mechanisms like separate learning rates for stage 1 vs stage 2, distinct forgetfulness parameters, and reward-specific perseveration.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Separate Learning Rates for Stages
This model hypothesizes that participants might learn about the value of the spaceships (Stage 1) at a different rate than they learn about the value of the aliens (Stage 2). This is biologically plausible as the first stage involves a transition structure while the second is a direct bandit task.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free RL with Separate Stage Learning Rates.
    
    Distinguishes between learning at the spaceship choice level (Stage 1)
    and the alien choice level (Stage 2).

    Parameters:
    lr_1: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1 (spaceships).
    lr_2: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 (aliens).
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control (1 = Pure MB, 0 = Pure MF).
    """
    lr_1, lr_2, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf

        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # Update Stage 1 (MF)
        # Note: In standard TD(0) for this task, the reward for stage 1 is the value of stage 2
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += lr_1 * delta_stage1
        
        # Update Stage 2
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += lr_2 * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model with Decay (Forgetting)
This model introduces a decay parameter. Unlike standard RL where unchosen options remain static, this model assumes memory trace decay: the values of unchosen actions slowly revert to 0 (or decay towards a baseline). This captures the phenomenon where participants "forget" the value of options they haven't explored recently.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free RL with Value Decay.

    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control.
    decay: [0, 1] Rate at which unchosen Q-values decay (1 = no decay, 0 = instant forgetting).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w, decay = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Reward-Dependent Perseveration
This model refines the concept of "stickiness". Instead of blindly repeating the last action, the participant is more likely to repeat the last action *if it was rewarded*. This is distinct from value learning because it is a transient bias based on the immediate previous outcome, rather than an integrated value history.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free RL with Reward-Dependent Perseveration.
    
    Adds a bias to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice, but the magnitude of this 
    bias depends on whether the previous trial yielded a reward.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control.
    persev_rew: [0, 5] Stickiness bonus if previous trial was rewarded.
    persev_unrew: [0, 5] Stickiness bonus if previous trial was unrewarded.
