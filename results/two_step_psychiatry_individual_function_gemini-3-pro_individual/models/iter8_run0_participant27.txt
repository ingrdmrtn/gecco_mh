Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task structure, exploring different mechanisms than those previously tested (such as pure model-based perseveration or simple hybrid models).

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Separate Learning Rates for Model-Free and Model-Based Updates
This model posits that the agent maintains both a Model-Based (planning) system and a Model-Free (habit) system for the first-stage choice. Crucially, instead of a mixing weight `w`, it allows the Model-Free system to learn the first-stage values directly with its own learning rate (`lr_mf1`), distinct from the second-stage learning rate (`lr_2`) used by both systems to update terminal values. This allows the habit system to evolve at a different speed than the value estimation of the aliens.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF with Distinct Stage-1 MF Learning Rate.
    
    This model combines Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) values at stage 1.
    Unlike standard hybrid models that use a mixing weight 'w', this model simply sums
    the Q-values from both systems. Crucially, it allows the stage-1 MF values to be 
    updated with a specific learning rate (lr_mf1), separate from the rate used for 
    stage-2 values (lr_2).
    
    Parameters:
    - lr_mf1: [0, 1] Learning rate for stage 1 Model-Free Q-values.
    - lr_2: [0, 1] Learning rate for stage 2 Q-values (used by both MB and MF).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    """
    lr_mf1, lr_2, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # MF value of spaceships
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Value of aliens (shared/base for MB)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # MB Component: Expected value based on transition matrix and max stage 2 value
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Combined Value: Sum of MF and MB estimates

        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Updates ---
        # 1. Update Stage 1 MF value using TD(1) logic (skipping the immediate stage 1 prediction error for simplicity 
        #    or assuming lambda=1, effectively updating Q1 based on the final reward)
        #    Standard approach: Q1_MF(t+1) = Q1_MF(t) + lr * (Reward - Q1_MF(t))
        delta_stage1_mf = reward[trial] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += lr_mf1 * delta_stage1_mf
        
        # 2. Update Stage 2 values (used by both systems next time)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += lr_2 * delta_stage2

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Based with "Stickiness" to Response Key (Motor Perseveration)
This model assumes the participant is purely Model-Based (calculating values via the transition matrix) but suffers from "motor perseveration." Unlike the previous `pers` model which biased the *choice* (Spaceship A vs U), this model biases the specific *motor action* if we conceptualize the second stage choice as repeating a key press. However, given the abstract data format, we will implement this as **Stage 2 Choice Perseveration**. The agent is more likely to pick the same alien index (0 or 1) as they did on the previous trial, regardless of which planet they are on. This captures a heuristic of "I'll just keep pressing the left button."

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based with Stage-2 Response Stickiness.
    
    The agent uses a pure Model-Based strategy to choose spaceships. 
    However, at Stage 2 (choosing aliens), the agent has a tendency to repeat 
    the same choice index (e.g., Alien 0 or Alien 1) as the previous trial, 
    regardless of which planet they are currently on.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for alien values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - resp_stick: [0, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen stage-2 action index.

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Reward vs. Punishment)
This model investigates if the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (finding gold) versus negative outcomes (no gold). This is a classic reinforcement learning phenomenon where "positive prediction errors" and "negative prediction errors" have distinct learning rates (`lr_pos` and `lr_neg`). It uses a standard Hybrid structure with a mixing weight `w` to combine Model-Based and Model-Free values.

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    - lr_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate when prediction error is positive.
