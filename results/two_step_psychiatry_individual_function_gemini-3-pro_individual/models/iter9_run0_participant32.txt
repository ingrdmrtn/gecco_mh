Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step decision task, designed to explore mechanisms distinct from the standard combinations provided in the feedback.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates for Stages
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns value updates at different speeds depending on the stage of the task. It combines Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) systems, but unlike standard models that share a learning rate across stages, this one allows for distinct plasticity in the high-level planning stage (Stage 1) versus the immediate reward stage (Stage 2).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates for Stages.

    This model implements a hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free architecture but distinguishes
    between the learning rate for the second-stage (direct reward learning) and the 
    first-stage (TD-learning from state transitions).

    Bounds:
    alpha_stage1: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1 (TD updates from Stage 2 values).
    alpha_stage2: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 (Direct updates from Reward).
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).

    alpha_stage1, alpha_stage2, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Fixed transition matrix for Model-Based system (70% common, 30% rare)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

        # --- Updates ---
        # Stage 1 Update (MF) using alpha_stage1

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free Q-Learning with Forgetting (Decay)
This model assumes the participant is purely Model-Free but has a memory constraint. Unlike standard Q-learning where unchosen options retain their values indefinitely, this model implements "passive forgetting" or value decay. Unchosen actions slowly revert to 0 (or decay toward neutral), simulating memory loss or uncertainty accumulation over time.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Q-Learning with Forgetting (Passive Decay).

    This model assumes a pure Model-Free learner where Q-values for unchosen options
    decay towards 0 on every trial. This captures the phenomenon where participants
    lose confidence in options they haven't explored recently.

    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    decay_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which unchosen Q-values decay (1 = no decay, 0 = instant forgetting).

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Outcome-Specific Learning Rates (Reward vs. Punishment)
This model investigates valence-dependent learning within the hybrid framework. It posits that the participant updates their Model-Based and Model-Free values differently depending on whether the final outcome was a "win" (reward > 0) or a "loss" (reward = 0). This asymmetry is often observed in clinical populations (e.g., depression or addiction).
