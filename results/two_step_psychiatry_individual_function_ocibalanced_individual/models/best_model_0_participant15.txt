    Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Choice Perseveration (Stickiness).
    
    This model relies solely on past rewards to update values (Model-Free)

    repeating the previous Stage 1 action, independent of reward.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    perseveration: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
