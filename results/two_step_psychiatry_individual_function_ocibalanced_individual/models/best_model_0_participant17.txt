    Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Choice Perseveration.
    
    This model relies on simple TD-learning but includes a 'choice kernel' parameter
    that biases the agent to repeat (or switch) their previous stage 1 action.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - stickiness: [0, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action. 
                         (Positive = perseveration, Negative = alternation, though bounds imply positive here).
