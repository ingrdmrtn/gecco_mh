    Pure Model-Based with Choice Stickiness and Reward-Modulated Beta.
    
    This model assumes a Pure Model-Based strategy. It adds a 'stickiness' 
    parameter to capture repetition bias. Uniquely, it modulates the 
    softmax beta based on the previous trial's outcome: a baseline beta 
    is boosted by 'beta_boost' if the previous trial was rewarded.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for Stage 2 values.
    beta_base: [0, 10] - Baseline inverse temperature.
    beta_boost: [0, 5] - Additional beta added if previous trial was rewarded.
    stickiness: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
