    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning.
    
    This model assumes the agent calculates the value of stage 1 actions
    solely by combining the known transition matrix with the learned values
    of the second-stage options. It does not use a cached model-free value
    for stage 1.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values for stage 2 are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
