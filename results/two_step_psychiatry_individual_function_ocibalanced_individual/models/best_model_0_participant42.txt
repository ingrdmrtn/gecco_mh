    Pure Model-Free Learner with Value Decay.
    
    This model assumes no knowledge of the transition structure (pure MF).
    However, it includes a decay parameter. On every trial, the Q-values of 
    unchosen actions decay towards 0. This simulates forgetting or 
    passive value erosion.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for chosen actions.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    decay: [0, 1] Decay rate for unchosen actions (1 = no decay, 0 = instant forgetting).
