Here are three cognitive models explaining participant behavior in the two-step task. They range from a pure model-free learner to a pure model-based learner, and finally a hybrid model that combines both strategies.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Free Learner (TD Learning)
This model assumes the participant does not use the transition structure of the task (common vs. rare transitions). Instead, they learn the value of the first-stage spaceships based solely on the reward received at the end of the trial, using a Temporal Difference (TD) learning mechanism. This is often called "TD(1)" or direct reinforcement of the first stage choice by the final outcome.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free (TD) Learner.
    
    This model learns action values based purely on reward history, ignoring
    the transition structure (common/rare paths). It updates stage 1 values
    using the reward received at stage 2.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Q-values initialization
    # Stage 1: 2 spaceships
    q_stage1 = np.zeros(2)  # Q(s1, a1)
    # Stage 2: 2 planets x 2 aliens
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Q(s2, a2)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        # Determine actual state (planet) arrived at
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---

        chosen_a1 = action_1[trial]
        chosen_a2 = action_2[trial]
        
        # Prediction error for Stage 2
        delta_stage2 = r - q_stage2[state_idx, chosen_a2]
        q_stage2[state_idx, chosen_a2] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # Prediction error for Stage 1
        # In a pure model-free TD(1) or SARSA-like view, we update Stage 1
        # based on the Stage 2 value or the reward directly. 
        # Here we use the standard TD update: Q1 moves toward Q2.
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2[state_idx, chosen_a2] - q_stage1[chosen_a1]
        q_stage1[chosen_a1] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Based Learner
This model assumes the participant relies entirely on a mental model of the task structure. They calculate the value of the first-stage spaceships by combining the known transition probabilities (70/30) with the learned values of the second-stage aliens. They do not maintain a separate cached value for the spaceships (no model-free Q-learning for Stage 1).

```python

    """

    the expected value of the resulting Stage 2 states, weighted by the 
    transition matrix. It does not cache Stage 1 Q-values directly.

    learning_rate: [0,1] Rate at which Stage 2 Q-values are updated.

### Model 3: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This is the classic "Daw two-step" model. It assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of both Model-Free (habitual) and Model-Based (goal-directed) systems to make the first-stage decision. A mixing parameter `w` determines the balance between the two systems.

    learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
