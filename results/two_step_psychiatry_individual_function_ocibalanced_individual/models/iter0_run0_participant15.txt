Here are three cognitive models based on the provided template and task description.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant builds a mental map of the task structure (Model-Based). They learn the value of the aliens (Stage 2) and propagate these values back to the spaceships (Stage 1) using the known transition probabilities (70/30). They do not use a separate model-free learning process for the first stage.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning.
    
    This model assumes the agent calculates the value of stage 1 actions solely 
    by planning: combining the learned values of stage 2 states with the known 
    transition matrix. It does not maintain a separate model-free Q-value for stage 1.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which stage 2 Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Transition matrix: Row 0 -> Planet 0 (70%), Planet 1 (30%); Row 1 -> Planet 0 (30%), Planet 1 (70%)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (Dyna-style)
This model represents a classic "Hybrid" learner. It maintains Model-Free Q-values for Stage 1 (based on direct experience) but mixes them with Model-Based Q-values (derived from the transition matrix and Stage 2 values). A mixing weight parameter (`w`) determines the balance between habit (MF) and planning (MB).

    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.

### Model 3: Choice Perseveration (Stickiness) Model
This model is a pure Model-Free learner (no transition matrix planning) but adds a "perseveration" parameter. This captures the tendency to repeat the same Stage 1 choice regardless of reward history, a common behavioral phenomenon.

    This model relies solely on past rewards to update values (Model-Free) 
    but includes a 'stickiness' bonus that increases the probability of 
    repeating the previous Stage 1 action, independent of reward.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    perseveration: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
