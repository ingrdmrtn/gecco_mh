Here are three cognitive models based on the provided template and task description.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based (MB) Learning
This model assumes the participant builds a mental map of the transition structure (Spaceship -> Planet) and uses the values of the second-stage aliens to plan their first-stage choice. It ignores Model-Free learning at the first stage, relying entirely on the computed values derived from the transition matrix and second-stage values.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    This model assumes the agent calculates the value of stage 1 actions solely by 
    projecting the value of stage 2 states through the transition matrix.
    It updates stage 2 values based on reward prediction error.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which stage 2 Q-values are updated.
    - beta_stage1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for the first choice (planning).
    - beta_stage2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for the second choice (alien selection).
    """
    learning_rate, beta_stage1, beta_stage2 = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition structure as described: A(0)->X(0) common, U(1)->Y(1) common
    # Assuming 0.7 common, 0.3 rare based on standard task versions
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for Stage 2: 2 planets x 2 aliens
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) + 0.5 # Initialize with neutral expectation

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Policy for the first choice (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate max value available at each planet
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (Dyna-style)
This is the classic "Hybrid" model often used for this task. It assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of Model-Free (habitual) learning and Model-Based (planning) learning to make the first-stage decision. A mixing parameter `w` determines the balance between the two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    The agent computes Stage 1 values as a weighted sum of Model-Free (TD-learning)
    and Model-Based (Planning) values.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for both stages.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for choice stochasticity (shared across stages).
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter. 1 = Pure Model-Based, 0 = Pure Model-Free.

### Model 3: Choice Kernel (Perseveration) Model
This model adds a "perseveration" bonus. It assumes the participant has a tendency to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of reward (or switch from it), captured by a choice kernel. This is purely Model-Free but accounts for motor or cognitive inertia often seen in human data.

```python

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - stickiness: [0, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
