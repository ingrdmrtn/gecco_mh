Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step task paradigm. They progress from a simple Model-Free learner to a classic Hybrid learner, and finally to a Perseveration-augmented Hybrid learner.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Free Learner (TD-Learning)
This model assumes the participant learns purely through trial-and-error (Temporal Difference learning). It does not use knowledge of the transition structure (the map of spaceships to planets). It updates Stage 1 values based on the reward received at Stage 2 (TD-1) or the value of the Stage 2 state (TD-0), often combined via an eligibility trace parameter $\lambda$. For simplicity and distinctness, this version implements a direct TD(1) style update where the Stage 1 value is updated directly by the final reward, ignoring the intermediate state value prediction error for the first stage update.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free learner (TD-1 style).
    
    This model ignores the transition structure (Model-Based) and learns 
    values solely based on experienced rewards. It updates the first-stage 
    choice based directly on the final outcome.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Initialize Q-values
    # Stage 1: 2 actions (Spaceships)
    q_stage1 = np.zeros(2) 
    # Stage 2: 2 states (Planets) x 2 actions (Aliens)
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2))

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        # Observe state transition
        state_idx = state[trial] # 0 or 1 (Planet X or Y)

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning ---
        # Prediction Error at Stage 2
        # The value of the chosen alien is updated by the reward
        pe_2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * pe_2

        # Prediction Error at Stage 1
        # In this simplified MF model, we update Stage 1 Q-value directly 
        # based on the final reward received (ignoring the intermediate state value)
        pe_1 = reward[trial] - q_stage1[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * pe_1

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Classic Hybrid Learner (Daw et al., 2011)
This is the standard model for this task. It assumes the participant uses a mixture of Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) strategies.
*   **Model-Based:** Calculates Stage 1 values by multiplying the transition matrix by the maximum values available at Stage 2 (planning).
*   **Model-Free:** Learns Stage 1 values via Temporal Difference learning (SARSA).
*   **Mixing:** The final Stage 1 value is a weighted average of $Q_{MB}$ and $Q_{MF}$ controlled by a mixing weight `w`.

```python

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Choice Perseveration
This model extends the Hybrid learner by adding a "stickiness" or perseveration parameter. Participants often repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of reward or model-based inference. This model captures that motor or cognitive inertia.
