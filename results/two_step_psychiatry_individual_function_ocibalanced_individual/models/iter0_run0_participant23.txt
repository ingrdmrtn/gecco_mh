Here are three cognitive models that explain decision-making in the two-step task. They build upon the provided template, introducing different mechanisms for how participants balance Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) learning.

### Model 1: Classic Hybrid Model (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This model implements the standard interpretation of the two-step task. It assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of a Model-Based (MB) controller (which knows the transition probabilities) and a Model-Free (MF) controller (which learns from direct experience). A weighting parameter `w` determines which system dominates.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Classic Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    This model assumes behavior is a mix of Model-Based (planning using the transition matrix)
    and Model-Free (TD learning) strategies.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate at which Q-values update (alpha).
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    - w: Weighting parameter (0 = Pure Model-Free, 1 = Pure Model-Based).
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0, 1]
    beta: [0, 10]
    w: [0, 1]

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)       # Model-free values for stage 1 (Spaceships)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Model-free values for stage 2 (Aliens per Planet)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

```

### Model 2: Perseverance Model (Stickiness)
This model adds a "choice stickiness" or perseverance parameter. Participants often repeat their previous choice regardless of reward (motor perseverance) or switch frequently. This model captures that tendency, which is distinct from reward-driven learning.

    - beta: Inverse temperature.
    - stickiness: Bias towards repeating the previous stage 1 choice. 
                  (Positive = repeat, Negative = switch).

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    # Track previous choice (initialize to -1 or handle first trial separately)
    last_choice_1 = -1

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        # Add stickiness bonus to the Q-values before softmax
        q_stage1_biased = q_stage1_mf.copy()

```

### Model 3: Separate Learning Rates for Stages
This model hypothesizes that learning happens differently for the high-level decision (spaceship choice) versus the low-level decision (alien choice). It uses two separate learning rates: `lr_stage1` and `lr_stage2`. This allows the model to capture if a participant updates their spaceship preference quickly but their alien preference slowly (or vice versa).

    - lr_stage2: Learning rate for updating alien values.
