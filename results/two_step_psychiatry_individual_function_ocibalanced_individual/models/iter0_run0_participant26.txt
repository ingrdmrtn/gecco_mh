Here are three cognitive models representing different strategies for the two-step decision-making task.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant builds a mental map of the task structure (transition probabilities) and plans their first-stage choice based on the expected value of the second-stage states. It ignores "Model-Free" caching of values at the first stage.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning.
    
    This model assumes the agent calculates the value of stage 1 actions
    solely by combining the known transition matrix with the learned values
    of the second-stage options. It does not use a cached model-free value
    for stage 1.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values for stage 2 are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described in the task (A->X mostly, U->Y mostly)
    # Rows: Action 1 (0 or 1), Cols: State (0 or 1)
    # Usually defined as: P(State|Action)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for the second stage (2 states x 2 aliens)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) + 0.5 # Initialize with neutral expectations

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Stage 1 Policy (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate the max value available in each state (greedy strategy)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---
        # Standard softmax on the available aliens in the current state
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
        
        # --- Learning ---
        # Update Stage 2 Q-values based on reward prediction error
        # Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + alpha * (r - Q(s,a))
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (Dyna-style)
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) systems to make the first-stage decision. A mixing parameter `w` determines the balance.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):

    The agent uses a weighted combination of model-based values (planning)
    and model-free values (caching) for the first-stage decision. 
    The second stage is purely model-free.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter (0 = Pure Model-Free, 1 = Pure Model-Based).

```

### Model 3: Pure Model-Free with Choice Perseveration
This model assumes the participant ignores the transition structure entirely (Pure Model-Free). However, it adds a "perseveration" parameter. This captures the tendency to simply repeat the last action taken at stage 1, regardless of reward history, which is a common heuristic in human behavior.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    the transition probabilities. It includes a 'perseveration' bonus that
    increases the probability of repeating the immediately preceding Stage 1 action.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - perseveration: [0, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
