Here are three cognitive models proposing different strategies for how participants might solve this two-step decision task.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (TD-0)
This model assumes the participant relies entirely on direct experience (Model-Free learning) without using the knowledge of the transition structure (Model-Based learning). It uses Temporal Difference (TD) learning to update values. The first-stage values are updated based on the value of the state reached in the second stage, and second-stage values are updated based on the reward received.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (TD-0).
    The participant updates values based solely on reward prediction errors 
    without considering the transition matrix structure.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix for reference, though unused by the MF agent logic directly
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for Stage 1 (2 spaceships)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) 
    # Q-values for Stage 2 (2 planets x 2 aliens)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) 

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        # Calculate probabilities using softmax on MF Q-values
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        # Observe state (planet)
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        # Calculate probabilities for the specific planet reached
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Learning ---
        # TD Error 1: Difference between value of state reached (Q2 of chosen alien) and chosen spaceship value
        # Note: Standard SARSA-like update uses Q(s', a') as the target
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # TD Error 2: Difference between reward received and expected value of alien
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This is the classic "Two-Step" model. It assumes the participant uses a mixture of two strategies. The Model-Based (MB) strategy calculates the value of spaceships by multiplying the known transition probabilities by the current best values of the planets. The Model-Free (MF) strategy learns spaceship values directly from experience. A mixing parameter `w` determines the balance between these two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.

    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

### Model 3: Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseveration
This model is a Model-Free learner (like Model 1) but includes a "perseveration" parameter. This parameter captures the tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice regardless of the reward outcome, a common heuristic found in human and animal behavior.

    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    perseveration: [0, 5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
