Here are three cognitive models designed to explain decision-making in the two-step task. They progress from a basic Model-Based/Model-Free hybrid to models incorporating perseverance and distinct learning rates.

### Model 1: Classic Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
This model implements the canonical analysis of the two-step task (Daw et al., 2011). It assumes the agent uses a weighted combination of a Model-Based (planning) system and a Model-Free (habitual) system to make the first-stage choice.

*   **Model-Based (MB):** Calculates values based on the transition matrix and the best possible second-stage values.
*   **Model-Free (MF):** Updates values based solely on prediction errors experienced at each stage.
*   **Mixing Weight (`w`):** Determines the balance between these two strategies.

```python

    Classic Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free RL Model.
    
    This model posits that the first-stage choice is a weighted combination of:
    1. A Model-Based value (Q_MB) derived from the transition matrix and stage 2 values.
    2. A Model-Free value (Q_MF) derived from direct TD-learning.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated (alpha).
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).

### Model 2: Hybrid Model with Choice Perseveration
This model extends the classic hybrid approach by acknowledging that humans often repeat their previous choice regardless of reward (perseveration or "stickiness").

*   **Choice Perseveration (`p`):** A parameter that adds a bonus to the Q-value of the action taken in the immediately preceding trial. This captures motor repetition or cognitive inertia.

### Model 3: Separate Learning Rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2
This model relaxes the assumption that the agent learns at the same speed in both stages of the task. The first stage (selecting a spaceship) is abstract and probabilistic, while the second stage (selecting an alien) is concrete and directly rewarded. This model allows for distinct plasticity in these two environments.

*   **`lr_stage1`**: Controls how fast the Model-Free value of the spaceships updates.
*   **`lr_stage2`**: Controls how fast the value of the aliens updates based on gold coins received.
