Here are three cognitive models representing different strategies for the two-step decision-making task.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant builds a mental map of the task structure (Model-Based). They calculate the value of the first-stage spaceships by combining the transition probabilities (which they know or learn) with the values of the second-stage aliens. They do not rely on cached "Model-Free" values for the first stage.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning.
    
    This model assumes the agent makes first-stage decisions solely by planning 
    forward using the transition matrix and second-stage values. It does not 
    maintain a separate model-free Q-value for the first stage.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate at which second-stage Q-values are updated [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice [0, 10].
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described in the task (0.7 common, 0.3 rare)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for Stage 2 (aliens): 2 planets x 2 aliens
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Initialized at 0 (or 0.5)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- POLICY FOR FIRST CHOICE (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate expected value of each spaceship based on transition matrix
        # and the best available option at the resulting planet.
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        qs_current_planet = q_stage2_mf[state_idx]
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * qs_current_planet)
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- ACTION VALUE UPDATING ---
        # Note: In a pure MB model, we don't update q_stage1_mf.
        # We only update the values of the aliens (Stage 2).
        
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (TD-Learning)
This model assumes the participant ignores the transition structure entirely. They learn the value of spaceships based purely on the prediction error from the second stage (Temporal Difference learning). If a spaceship leads to a high-value state, its value increases, regardless of whether the transition was common or rare.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    This model relies on cached values for both stages. It updates the first-stage
    values using the Temporal Difference (TD) error from the second stage, ignoring
    transition probabilities.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate at which Q-values are updated [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice [0, 10].
    - eligibility_trace: How much the second-stage reward affects the first stage directly (lambda) [0, 1].

    learning_rate, beta, eligibility_trace = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)

        # This allows the final reward to 'leak' back to update the spaceship choice directly

### Model 3: Hybrid Model (Model-Based + Model-Free)
This is the classic "Daw two-step" model logic. It assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of both strategies. They maintain model-free values (based on experience) and model-based values (based on planning). A mixing parameter (`w`) determines which system dominates the decision.

```python

    """

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate at which Q-values are updated [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice [0, 10].
    - w: Weighting parameter [0, 1]. 1 = Pure Model-Based, 0 = Pure Model-Free.
