Here are three cognitive models representing different strategies for the two-step task. They range from a pure Model-Free learner to a hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free learner, and finally a model that incorporates perseveration (stickiness).

### Model 1: Pure Model-Free Learner (TD Learning)
This model assumes the participant ignores the transition structure (common vs. rare) and simply learns which Stage 1 actions lead to rewards using Temporal Difference (TD) learning (SARSA). It updates values based on the immediate prediction error at Stage 2 and the reward prediction error at the end.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free (TD-0) Learner.
    This model learns values for Stage 1 and Stage 2 solely based on reward history
    and temporal difference errors, ignoring the transition matrix structure.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated (alpha).
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice stochasticity.
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Initialize Q-values
    # Stage 1: 2 choices (Spaceships)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) 
    # Stage 2: 2 states (Planets) x 2 choices (Aliens)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        # Calculate probabilities using Softmax on Stage 1 Q-values
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        # Observe state (planet)
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        # Calculate probabilities using Softmax on Stage 2 Q-values for the specific state
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Learning (TD Updates) ---
        
        # 1. Prediction Error for Stage 1 (TD(0)):
        # The value of the chosen stage 2 action acts as the target for stage 1
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # 2. Prediction Error for Stage 2:
        # The actual reward acts as the target for stage 2
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It calculates Stage 1 values as a weighted mixture of Model-Free (MF) values (learned from experience) and Model-Based (MB) values (calculated using the known transition matrix and max Stage 2 values). A mixing parameter `w` controls the balance.

```python

    """

    Parameters:

    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0,1] - Mixing weight. 0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix: A->X (0.7), U->Y (0.7)
    # Rows: Actions (0,1), Cols: States (0,1)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Choice Perseveration
This model extends the Hybrid model by adding a "stickiness" or perseveration parameter. Participants often have a tendency to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of reward history. This model captures that bias.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):

    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0,1] - MB/MF mixing weight.
    perseveration: [0,5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
