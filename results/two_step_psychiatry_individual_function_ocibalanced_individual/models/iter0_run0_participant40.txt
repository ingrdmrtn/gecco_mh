Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step task paradigm, implementing different strategies for learning and decision-making.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based (MB) Learner
This model assumes the participant primarily uses a model-based strategy. They learn the values of the second-stage aliens (Model-Free Q-learning at stage 2) but make stage 1 choices by calculating the expected value based on the transition structure of the task (70%/30%), rather than learning stage 1 values directly from experience.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    This model assumes the agent calculates the value of stage 1 actions
    by combining the known transition matrix with the learned values of 
    stage 2 states (aliens). It does not maintain separate MF values for stage 1.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Rate at which stage 2 values are updated.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature parameter controlling choice stochasticity.
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described in the task (A->X/Y, U->X/Y)
    # Rows are Stage 1 actions (0, 1), Cols are Stage 2 states (0, 1)
    # Assuming Action 0 -> State 0 commonly (0.7) and Action 1 -> State 1 commonly (0.7)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) 

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- POLICY FOR FIRST CHOICE (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate the max value available in each state (best alien per planet)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        
        # Bellman equation: Q_MB(a1) = sum(P(s2|a1) * max(Q(s2, a2)))

        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- ACTION VALUE UPDATING ---
        # No Stage 1 MF update because this is a pure MB model.
        
        # Stage 2 Update (Standard Q-learning)
        # Prediction Error: R - Q(s2, a2)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Free / Model-Based Learner
This is the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" style model. It assumes the participant's brain computes both a Model-Free value (based on direct reinforcement history) and a Model-Based value (based on planning) for the first stage. A mixing weight parameter `w` determines which system controls the decision.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Model.

    learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.

    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

### Model 3: Perseveration Model (Habitual Learner)
This model is primarily a Model-Free learner (ignores the transition matrix structure) but includes a "perseveration" parameter. This parameter captures the tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice regardless of reward, a common behavior in human and animal subjects often conflated with learning.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    stickiness/perseveration bonus to the previously chosen action at Stage 1.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
    perseveration: [0,5] Bonus added to the log-odds of repeating the previous stage 1 choice.
