Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step task paradigm. They progress from a simple Model-Based strategy to a hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free learner, and finally to a model that incorporates separate learning rates for the two stages.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
This model assumes the participant builds a mental model of the task structure (the transition matrix) and plans their first-stage actions based on the expected value of the second-stage states. It ignores direct reinforcement of the first-stage choice (Model-Free learning) and focuses entirely on the calculated values of the planets.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Learner.
    This model assumes the agent calculates the value of stage 1 actions solely 
    by combining the known transition matrix with the learned values of stage 2 aliens.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which stage 2 (alien) values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Fixed transition matrix as described in task: A->X (0->0) is common (0.7)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for the aliens (2 planets * 2 aliens per planet)
    # Usually represented as (2, 2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # 0.5 initialization is often standard, but 0 is fine given template

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- STAGE 1 POLICY (Model-Based) ---
        # Calculate max value available at each planet (state)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        
        # Bellman equation: Q_MB(s1, a1) = sum(P(s2|s1, a1) * max(Q(s2, a2)))
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Softmax selection for stage 1

        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial] # Actual planet arrived at

        # --- STAGE 2 POLICY ---
        # Standard value-based choice between aliens
        qs_current_state = q_stage2_mf[state_idx]
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * qs_current_state)
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- UPDATING ---
        # No stage 1 update in a pure MB model (or rather, the transition matrix is fixed)
        
        # Update stage 2 values based on reward
        # Q(s2, a2) = Q(s2, a2) + alpha * (reward - Q(s2, a2))
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This is the classic "Daw two-step" model formulation. It assumes the agent computes a weighted average of Model-Based values (planning) and Model-Free values (habitual caching of rewards) to make the first-stage decision. A mixing parameter `w` determines the balance between these two systems.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner.
    Combines planned values (MB) and cached values (MF) for the first stage choice.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for both stages.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).

    # Model-Free Q-values for Stage 1 (Spaceships)

```

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Distinct Stage Learning Rates
This model extends the hybrid approach by acknowledging that learning dynamics might differ between the abstract decision of choosing a spaceship (Stage 1) and the concrete feedback of receiving a coin from an alien (Stage 2). It also includes a `choice_stickiness` parameter to capture the tendency to repeat the previous action regardless of value.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    - lr_1: [0, 1] Learning rate for stage 1 (spaceships).
    - lr_2: [0, 1] Learning rate for stage 2 (aliens).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
