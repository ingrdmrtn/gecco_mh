Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task structure.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Choice Perseveration
This model extends the standard Hybrid (MB/MF) learner by adding a "stickiness" or perseveration parameter. Participants often tend to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of reward history (motor perseveration) or switch less often than optimal. This model accounts for that bias.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner with Choice Perseveration.
    
    Adds a 'stickiness' bonus to the previously chosen action at Stage 1,
    capturing the tendency to repeat choices regardless of value.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
    w: [0,1] Weight parameter (1 = MB, 0 = MF).
    stickiness: [0,5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w, stickiness = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) 

    # Track previous choice for perseveration (initialize as None or handle index)
    last_action_1 = -1

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Policy for Choice 1 ---
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Combine MB and MF values
        q_net = (w * q_stage1_mb) + ((1 - w) * q_stage1_mf)
        
        # Add stickiness bonus if not the first trial
        if last_action_1 != -1:
            q_net[last_action_1] += stickiness

        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)

        last_action_1 = action_1[trial]
        chosen_a1 = action_1[trial]
        chosen_a2 = action_2[trial]

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model with Separate Stage Learning Rates
This model posits that learning happens at different speeds for the two stages. Stage 2 is a direct bandit task (immediate reward), while Stage 1 relies on temporal difference learning (prediction of a future state value). Using separate learning rates (`lr_stage1` and `lr_stage2`) allows the model to capture differences in how quickly participants update their spaceship preferences versus their alien preferences.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Dual Learning Rates.
    
    Uses distinct learning rates for Stage 1 (Spaceship choice) and 
    Stage 2 (Alien choice), acknowledging the different cognitive demands
    of temporal difference learning vs direct reward learning.

    Parameters:
    lr_stage1: [0,1] Learning rate for Stage 1 transitions/values.
    lr_stage2: [0,1] Learning rate for Stage 2 reward values.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rate Hybrid Model
This model incorporates a biological constraint often observed in dopamine-based reinforcement learning: separate sensitivities to positive prediction errors (better than expected) and negative prediction errors (worse than expected). This is implemented via two learning rates, `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`.

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):

    alpha_neg: [0,1] Learning rate when prediction error is negative.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
    w: [0,1] Weight parameter (1 = MB, 0 = MF).
