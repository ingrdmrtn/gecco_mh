Here are three new cognitive models exploring different parameter combinations and mechanisms for the two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Reward Sensitivity
This model explores the idea that individuals might not value the reward of "1 coin" simply as 1. Instead, they might have a subjective utility or sensitivity to reward, scaling the impact of the outcome. This adds a parameter `reward_sensitivity` while keeping the hybrid (MB/MF) structure.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Reward Sensitivity.
    
    This model includes a `reward_sensitivity` parameter that scales the 
    subjective value of the reward received. This allows the model to capture 
    individual differences in how strongly positive outcomes drive learning.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - w: [0,1] Weighting parameter (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB).
    - reward_sensitivity: [0,10] Scalar multiplier for the reward signal.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w, reward_sensitivity = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Model-based value estimation
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Hybrid value estimation
        q_net = (w * q_stage1_mb) + ((1 - w) * q_stage1_mf)
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Learning ---
        # Scale the raw reward by sensitivity
        subjective_reward = reward[trial] * reward_sensitivity
        
        # TD-error for stage 1 (using unscaled Q-values for consistency with standard TD)
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # TD-error for stage 2
        delta_stage2 = subjective_reward - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free with Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda))
Instead of a hybrid model, this model assumes a purely Model-Free strategy but introduces an **eligibility trace** parameter (`lambda_eligibility`). This allows the stage 2 reward to directly influence the stage 1 choice more effectively than simple 1-step TD learning, essentially "smearing" the reward back in time. This is a classic reinforcement learning mechanism often contrasted with Model-Based learning.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Learner with Eligibility Traces (TD-Lambda).
    
    Instead of a model-based component, this model uses an eligibility trace 
    parameter (lambda) to allow the second-stage reward to update first-stage 
    values more directly. High lambda makes it behave more like Monte Carlo learning.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate.
    - beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
    - lambda_eligibility: [0,1] Decay rate for the eligibility trace.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, lambda_eligibility = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # No transition matrix needed for pure MF

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates
Standard models assume the learning rate is constant across stages. This model proposes that participants might learn at different speeds for the high-level spaceship choice (Stage 1) versus the specific alien choice (Stage 2). It introduces `learning_rate_stg1` and `learning_rate_stg2`.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates per Stage.
    
    This model allows for different plasticity in the two stages of the task.
    It might capture if a participant learns the alien preferences quickly 
    but changes their spaceship preference slowly (or vice versa).
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate_stg1: [0,1] Update rate for Stage 1 Q-values.
    - learning_rate_stg2: [0,1] Update rate for Stage 2 Q-values.
    - beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0,1] MB/MF weighting.
