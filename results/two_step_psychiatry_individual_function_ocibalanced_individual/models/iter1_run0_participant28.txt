Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task. These models diverge from the previous feedback by exploring separate learning rates for different stages, interaction effects between model-based/model-free systems, and outcome-specific perseveration.

### Model 1: Separate Learning Rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2
This model hypothesizes that the participant might update their expectations about the spaceships (Stage 1) at a different speed than they learn about the aliens (Stage 2). This is often useful if the volatility of the environment differs between the two stages.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Separate Learning Rates.

    Distinguishes between learning the value of Stage 1 actions (spaceships) 
    and Stage 2 actions (aliens).

    Bounds:
    alpha1: [0,1] - Learning rate for Stage 1 (spaceships).
    alpha2: [0,1] - Learning rate for Stage 2 (aliens).
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0=MF, 1=MB).
    """
    alpha1, alpha2, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

        # policy for the second choice

        # Update Stage 1 MF value using alpha1
        # Note: Standard TD(0) update for stage 1 usually uses the value of the state reached
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += alpha1 * delta_stage1
        
        # Update Stage 2 MF value using alpha2
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += alpha2 * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Lambda-weighted Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda))
Instead of a strict Model-Based vs. Model-Free dichotomy, this model uses an eligibility trace parameter (`lambda`) to determine how much the Stage 2 reward directly updates the Stage 1 choice. If `lambda` is 1, the Stage 1 value is fully updated by the final reward (Monte Carlo-like). If `lambda` is 0, it is pure TD learning (updating only based on the next state's value). This replaces the `w` parameter with a different mechanism for connecting stages.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    TD(lambda) Model.

    Uses an eligibility trace parameter to modulate how strongly the Stage 2 
    prediction error propagates back to Stage 1. This removes the explicit 'w' 
    parameter and relies on the eligibility trace to bridge the stages.

    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0,1]
    beta: [0,10]
    lam: [0,1] - Eligibility trace decay parameter (lambda).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, lam = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]]) # Not used in pure MF/TD(lambda) usually, but kept for structure
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1 = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice (Pure Model-Free approach here)

### Model 3: Reward-Dependent Perseveration
This model modifies the concept of "stickiness." Instead of blindly repeating the last action, the participant might only be sticky if they were *rewarded* on the previous trial ("Win-Stay"). This captures a heuristic strategy often seen in simpler reinforcement learning contexts.

```python
