Here are three new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task. These models introduce eligibility traces, separate learning rates for positive/negative outcomes, and a hybrid model-based/model-free architecture.

### Model 1: TD(1) / Eligibility Trace Learner
This model extends the standard temporal difference learning by allowing the reward at the second stage to directly update the first-stage Q-values. Instead of just updating Stage 1 based on the Stage 2 Q-value (TD(0)), the reward "passes through" to update the original choice, bridging the gap between action and outcome more strongly. This is effectively setting the eligibility trace parameter $\lambda = 1$.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    TD(1) Learner (Direct Reinforcement of Stage 1).
    This model assumes that the reward received at the second stage directly 
    updates the value of the first-stage choice, in addition to the standard 
    TD updates. This mimics an eligibility trace of lambda=1.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate for updating Q-values based on prediction errors.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # Initialize probabilities and Q-values
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # Q(s1, a1)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Q(s2, a2) - 2 states (planets), 2 actions (aliens)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        # Transition to state (planet)
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
        
        # --- Learning ---
        # 1. Update Stage 2 value based on Reward
        # Prediction error for stage 2
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # 2. Update Stage 1 value based on Stage 2 Value (Standard TD)
        # Prediction error for stage 1 (based on the value of the state we landed in)
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

        # 3. Direct Reinforcement (TD(1)-like update)
        # We also push the stage 2 prediction error back to stage 1.
        # This acts like an eligibility trace connecting the final reward to the first choice.
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive/Negative)
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from wins (getting gold) versus losses (getting nothing). This "optimism" or "pessimism" bias is captured by having two separate learning rates: `alpha_pos` for trials where reward=1, and `alpha_neg` for trials where reward=0.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Asymmetric Learning Rate Model.

    negative outcomes (reward=0/omission), allowing for optimistic or 
    pessimistic updating biases.

    Parameters:
    alpha_pos: [0, 1] - Learning rate when reward is received (1).
    alpha_neg: [0, 1] - Learning rate when reward is omitted (0).
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # Determine current learning rate based on outcome
        if reward[trial] == 1:
            current_lr = alpha_pos

### Model 3: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner
This is the classic "Daw" hybrid model. It assumes the participant uses a mixture of two strategies:
1.  **Model-Free (MF):** Habitual learning (repeating what was rewarded).
2.  **Model-Based (MB):** Planning based on the transition structure (knowing that Spaceship A -> Planet X).
The parameter `w` controls the balance between these two systems for the first-stage choice.
