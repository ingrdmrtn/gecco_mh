Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task structure. I have focused on introducing distinct mechanisms like pure model-based learning, a hybrid learner with separate learning rates for each stage, and a model that incorporates reward sensitivity/punishment asymmetry.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based Learner
This model assumes the participant builds a mental map of the task structure (transitions) and plans forward. Instead of learning Stage 1 values directly from experience (TD-learning), it calculates them on the fly by combining the known transition matrix with the learned values of the second stage. This contrasts with the Model-Free learner provided in the feedback.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Learner.
    
    This model calculates Stage 1 values strictly by planning: multiplying the 
    transition probabilities by the maximum expected value of the next stage.
    Stage 2 values are learned via standard Rescorla-Wagner updates.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Rate at which Stage 2 Q-values are updated [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice [0, 10].
    """
    learning_rate, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Fixed transition matrix as described in the task (70% common, 30% rare)
    # Row 0: Spaceship A (0) -> [Planet X (0), Planet Y (1)]
    # Row 1: Spaceship U (1) -> [Planet X (0), Planet Y (1)]
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    # Q-values for Stage 2 (aliens) only. Stage 1 is computed, not stored.
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) 

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy (Model-Based Planning) ---
        # Value of a spaceship = sum(P(planet|spaceship) * max(Value(aliens_on_planet)))
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1) # Max value available on each planet
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mb)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]

        state_idx = state[trial] # Planet arrived at

        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Value Updating ---
        # Only Stage 2 is updated via prediction error
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # Stage 1 values are re-computed at the start of the next loop based on new q_stage2_mf

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates
This model addresses the possibility that learning happens at different speeds for the high-level planning (Stage 1) versus the specific concrete rewards (Stage 2). It combines Model-Based and Model-Free values using a weighting parameter `w`, but critically uses two different learning rates (`alpha1` and `alpha2`) for the two stages.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    the second stage (Reward-update).

    Parameters:
    - alpha1: Learning rate for Stage 1 (TD-learning) [0, 1].
    - alpha2: Learning rate for Stage 2 (Reward-learning) [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice [0, 10].

    alpha1, alpha2, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rate (Reward vs. No-Reward)
This model investigates if the participant learns differently from success (getting a coin) versus failure (getting 0 coins). This is a pure Model-Free learner, but it splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` (for positive prediction errors) and `alpha_neg` (for negative prediction errors). This is crucial in psychiatry research to detect reward sensitivity vs. punishment sensitivity.
