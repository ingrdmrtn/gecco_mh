Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task. These models introduce variations in how learning rates are handled and how stage-1 values are computed, distinct from the standard hybrid models previously tested.

### Model 1: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive vs. Negative Prediction Errors)
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (finding gold) versus negative outcomes (no gold). This is a common finding in reinforcement learning where "optimism" or "pessimism" biases learning. It uses a pure Model-Based strategy for Stage 1 valuation but splits the Stage 2 update into two separate learning rates.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Based Model with Asymmetric Learning Rates.
    
    This model assumes the participant uses a model-based strategy to value Stage 1 choices.
    However, at Stage 2, they update their value estimates differently depending on whether 
    the outcome was better than expected (positive prediction error) or worse (negative PE).
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    - alpha_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate for negative prediction errors.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    """
    alpha_pos, alpha_neg, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values for Stage 2 (aliens)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy (Model-Based) ---
        # Value of Stage 1 is the expected max value of Stage 2 weighted by transitions
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mb)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Learning Updates ---
        # Calculate prediction error at Stage 2
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        
        # Apply asymmetric learning rates
        if delta_stage2 >= 0:
            q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += alpha_pos * delta_stage2
        else:
            q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += alpha_neg * delta_stage2
        
    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free TD(1) / Direct Reinforcement
This model assumes the participant ignores the transition structure entirely (Pure Model-Free) but uses "eligibility traces" or direct reinforcement (TD(1)) to update the first-stage choice based on the final reward. This contrasts with the standard TD(0) approach which only updates Stage 1 based on the value of the state reached. This captures a strategy where the participant simply repeats the spaceship choice that led to a reward, regardless of the intermediate planet.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Model with Direct Reinforcement (TD(1)).
    
    This model ignores the transition structure (Model-Free). It updates Stage 1 Q-values
    directly based on the final reward received (TD-lambda=1), rather than bootstrapping
    off the Stage 2 value. This creates a strong tendency to repeat successful Stage 1
    actions regardless of the transition type (common/rare).
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - decay: [0, 1] Decay rate for unchosen options (passive forgetting) to allow flexibility.

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Values for aliens

### Model 3: Model-Based with Stickiness (Choice Autocorrelation)
This model is a variation of the Pure Model-Based learner but adds a "stickiness" or choice autocorrelation parameter specifically for the first stage. Unlike standard perseveration which is often added to hybrid models, here we isolate it within a pure MB framework. This tests if the participant generally plans using the model but has a primitive tendency to simply repeat their last motor response (spaceship choice) regardless of reward history.

    """

    biasing the participant to repeat the previously chosen spaceship regardless of outcome.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - stickiness: [0, 5] Bonus added to the value of the previously chosen action (Choice Autocorrelation).
