Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task. These models introduce variations in how learning rates are handled, how rewards are processed, and how eligibility traces are used.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Distinct MB/MF Learning Rates
This model hypothesizes that the Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) systems might update at different speeds. While standard models often use a single learning rate, this model separates them, allowing the MF system (which relies on direct reinforcement) to learn at a different pace than the second-stage value estimation used by the MB system.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Separate Learning Rates.
    Distinguishes between the learning rate for Stage 1 MF values and Stage 2 values (used by MB).
    
    Parameters:
    lr_mf: [0,1] - Learning rate for Stage 1 Model-Free values.
    lr_mb: [0,1] - Learning rate for Stage 2 values (which drive the Model-Based component).
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    """
    lr_mf, lr_mb, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # These serve as the state-values for MB planning

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # Update Stage 1 MF value using the specific MF learning rate
        # Note: Standard MF updates Stage 1 based on Stage 2 value (SARSA-like)
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += lr_mf * delta_stage1

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Learner with Reward Sensitivity (Rho)
This model introduces a non-linear transformation of the reward. The parameter `rho` scales the subjective value of the reward outcome. This captures individual differences in how strongly a unit of reward (gold coins) impacts the internal value updates. A high `rho` implies high sensitivity to gains, while a low `rho` implies indifference.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).

### Model 3: Lambda-Hybrid Learner (Eligibility Trace)
This model replaces the explicit Model-Based/Model-Free weighting parameter `w` with an eligibility trace parameter `lambda`. Instead of calculating a separate MB value, this model uses `lambda` to determine how much the Stage 1 value is updated by the final reward (Stage 2 outcome). If `lambda` is 1, the Stage 1 value is fully updated by the reward (mimicking MB-like long-range temporal credit assignment). If `lambda` is 0, Stage 1 is only updated by the transition to Stage 2 (TD(0)).

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    TD(Lambda) Learner.
    Uses an eligibility trace 'lam' to modulate how much the final reward impacts Stage 1 values directly.
    This effectively blends MF (TD(0)) and MB-like (TD(1)) updating without a distinct planner.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Learning rate.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    lam: [0,1] - Eligibility trace decay parameter (0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo/TD(1)).
