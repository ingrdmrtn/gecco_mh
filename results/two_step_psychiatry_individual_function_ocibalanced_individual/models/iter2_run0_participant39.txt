Here are three new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms than the ones previously tested. They introduce concepts like hybrid learning (mixing Model-Based and Model-Free), distinct learning rates for the two stages, and asymmetric learning based on reward outcomes.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model (Model-Based + Model-Free Mixture)
This model posits that participants use a weighted combination of Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) systems to make their first-stage choices. The parameter `w` controls the balance between these two systems.

```python

    """

    (learning from direct experience) values.
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate for both stages.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure Model-Free, 1 = Pure Model-Based).

    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)       # Model-Free values for stage 1

```

### Model 2: Dual Learning Rates (Stage 1 vs Stage 2)
This model assumes that the participant might learn at different speeds for the high-level decision (choosing a spaceship) versus the low-level decision (choosing an alien). This is purely Model-Based for Stage 1 planning, but allows the estimation of the Stage 2 values (which feed into the planner) to be decoupled from general learning noise.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Based with Separate Learning Rates for Stage 2.
    
    This model uses Model-Based planning for the first stage. However, it
    allows for two different learning rates: one effectively governing how
    quickly the second-stage values update (`alpha_2`), and a separate parameter
    implied for how strictly the agent follows the transition matrix logic.
    Here we specifically test if Stage 2 values update differently than standard TD.
    
    Bounds:
    alpha_2: [0, 1] - Learning rate specifically for updating alien values (Stage 2).

        # We only update Stage 2 values here, as Stage 1 is derived purely from planning
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]

```

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning (Reward vs. No-Reward)
This model investigates if the participant updates their value estimates differently when they receive a reward (gold coin) versus when they receive nothing (0 coins). This is a "confirmation bias" or "positivity bias" style model applied to the second stage values, which then propagate up via Model-Based planning.
