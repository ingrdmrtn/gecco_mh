Here are three new cognitive models exploring alternative mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Inverse Temperature Scaling (Beta Scaling)
This model posits that the participant's exploration/exploitation trade-off (`beta`) is not static but scales with the magnitude of the learned values. Often, as value estimates grow, the effective difference between options can become artificially large or small. This model introduces a scaling parameter `beta_scale` to normalize or adjust the temperature based on the total value in the system, potentially stabilizing choice probabilities over time.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Beta Scaling.
    
    This model adjusts the inverse temperature (beta) dynamically based on the 
    magnitude of the Q-values. This helps maintain a consistent level of 
    stochasticity even if Q-values drift in magnitude.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta_base: [0,10] Base inverse temperature.
    - beta_scale: [0,1] Scaling factor. If 0, beta is constant. If >0, beta decreases as Q-values increase.
    - w: [0,1] Weighting parameter (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta_base, beta_scale, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

        # Calculate effective beta based on average Q-value magnitude to prevent explosion/vanishing
        avg_q = np.mean(np.abs(q_stage2_mf)) + 1e-5 # avoid div by zero
        effective_beta = beta_base / (1 + beta_scale * avg_q)

    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Learner with Forgetting (Decay)
Standard reinforcement learning assumes values are maintained perfectly until updated. However, human memory decays. This model introduces a `decay_rate` parameter. On every trial, unchosen options (or all options) slowly decay back to a neutral value (0 or 0.5), representing forgetting. This can explain why participants might switch away from a previously good option if they haven't visited it in a while.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Passive Value Decay (Forgetting).
    
    This model assumes that Q-values for all options decay towards zero 
    on every trial, simulating forgetting or a 'leak' in memory.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate for chosen options.
    - decay_rate: [0,1] Rate at which Q-values decay toward 0 each trial.
    - beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Counterfactual Updating
In standard Q-learning, only the chosen option is updated. However, in the second stage of this task, the rewards are binary (0 or 1). A participant might infer that if they chose Alien A and got 0 coins, Alien B (the unchosen option) *might* have had 1 coin. This model includes a `counterfactual_lr` which updates the unchosen option in the opposite direction of the chosen option's outcome (or towards the expected inverse).

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate for the chosen option.
    - cf_learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate for the unchosen option (Counterfactual).
