Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task structure, introducing mechanisms like separate learning rates for stage 1 and stage 2, eligibility traces for direct reinforcement, and a "primitive" model-based strategy.

### Model 1: Separate Stage Learning Rates (Hybrid)
This model hypothesizes that participants might learn at different speeds for the high-level spaceship choice (Stage 1) versus the specific alien choice (Stage 2). It separates `learning_rate_1` and `learning_rate_2` while maintaining the hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free structure.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Separate Stage Learning Rates.
    Allows for different plasticity in Stage 1 (spaceships) vs Stage 2 (aliens).
    
    Parameters:
    lr_1: [0,1] - Learning rate for Stage 1 MF values.
    lr_2: [0,1] - Learning rate for Stage 2 MF values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature (softmax sensitivity).
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = pure MF, 1 = pure MB).
    """
    lr_1, lr_2, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # 2 states (planets), 2 actions (aliens)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Calculate Model-Based values
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Combine MB and MF
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]

        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Updates ---
        # Stage 1 MF update using TD(0) prediction error from Stage 2 value
        # Note: We use the value of the CHOSEN state/action pair in stage 2 as the target
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += lr_1 * delta_stage1
        
        # Stage 2 MF update using Reward
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += lr_2 * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Direct Reinforcement (TD(1) / Eligibility Trace)
This model removes the explicit Model-Based component (`w`) and instead implements a pure Model-Free learner with an eligibility trace parameter (`lambda`). This allows the reward at the end of the trial to directly update the Stage 1 choice, bridging the gap between the first action and the final outcome without needing a transition model.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free Learner with Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda)).
    The reward directly reinforces the Stage 1 choice modulated by lambda.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    lam: [0,1] - Eligibility trace decay (0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo/TD(1)).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, lam = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    # No transition matrix needed for pure MF
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]

        # --- Updates ---
        # 1. Update Stage 1 based on prediction of Stage 2 (TD(0) part)

        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_1
        
        # 2. Update Stage 2 based on Reward
        delta_2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_2
        
        # 3. Eligibility Trace Update: Apply Stage 2 RPE (delta_2) to Stage 1 choice
        # If lam is high, the final reward 'leaks' back to the first choice directly
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * lam * delta_2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: "Primitive" Model-Based (Unlearning)
Instead of calculating expected values using the full transition matrix on every trial (standard MB), this model uses a "Model-Based Unlearning" heuristic. If a rare transition occurs and leads to a bad outcome, the agent assumes the *other* Stage 1 option is now better. It includes a `decay` parameter which causes unchosen action values to slowly revert to 0 (forgetting).

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Passive Decay (Forgetting).
    Unchosen actions slowly decay toward zero, simulating memory loss.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for chosen actions.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0,1] - MB/MF mixing weight.
    decay: [0,1] - Rate at which unchosen Q-values decay to 0.

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
