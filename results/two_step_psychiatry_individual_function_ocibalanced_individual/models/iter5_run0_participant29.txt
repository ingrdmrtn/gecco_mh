Here are three new cognitive models that introduce distinct mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task. These models explore eligibility traces, separate learning rates for different stages, and a hybrid structure that mixes model-based and model-free values with a weighting parameter.

### Model 1: TD(1) / Monte Carlo Learner
This model assumes the participant updates the first-stage choice based directly on the final reward outcome, rather than just the second-stage value estimate. This corresponds to a temporal difference learning algorithm with an eligibility trace parameter $\lambda=1$ (or effectively Monte Carlo updates for the first stage), skipping the intermediate TD error.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    TD(1) / Direct Reinforcement Learner.
    Instead of using the second-stage value to update the first stage (TD(0)),
    this model updates the first-stage action value directly based on the 
    final reward received.

    Parameters:
    lr_stage1: [0, 1] - Learning rate for first-stage actions based on final reward.
    lr_stage2: [0, 1] - Learning rate for second-stage actions.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    """
    lr_stage1, lr_stage2, beta = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_mf)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # policy for the second choice
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # Update Stage 1: Direct reinforcement from reward (TD(1)-like logic)
        # Note: We ignore the transition structure and the second stage value prediction here
        delta_stage1 = reward[trial] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += lr_stage1 * delta_stage1
        
        # Update Stage 2: Standard Q-learning
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += lr_stage2 * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free with Perseveration
This model combines the classic "Daw et al. (2011)" hybrid structure with a perseveration (stickiness) parameter. It calculates a weighted average of Model-Based (planning using the transition matrix) and Model-Free (habitual) values for the first-stage decision, while also accounting for a tendency to repeat the previous action regardless of reward.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner with Perseveration.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate for MF Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive/Negative)
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (finding gold) versus negative outcomes (no gold). It splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg` but applies this logic to a standard Model-Free TD(0) learner without model-based planning.

```python

    lr_neg: [0, 1] - Learning rate when prediction error is negative.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
