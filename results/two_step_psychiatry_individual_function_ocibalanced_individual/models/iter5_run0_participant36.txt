Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task. These models introduce variations in how rewards are processed (outcome sensitivity), how learning rates might differ between stages, and how eligibility traces are implemented.

### Model 1: Outcome-Sensitive Learning (Reward-Punishment Asymmetry)
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (finding gold) versus negative outcomes (no gold). Instead of a single learning rate, it splits the learning rate into `alpha_rew` (for rewards) and `alpha_pun` (for zero rewards). This is often relevant in psychiatric populations where reward sensitivity or punishment avoidance might be altered.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Outcome-Sensitive Hybrid Learner.
    Differentiates learning rates based on whether the outcome was a reward or not.
    
    Parameters:
    alpha_rew: [0,1] - Learning rate for rewarded trials (reward > 0).
    alpha_pun: [0,1] - Learning rate for unrewarded trials (reward <= 0).
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB).
    """
    alpha_rew, alpha_pun, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Value Updating ---
        # Determine which learning rate to use based on the final outcome
        current_alpha = alpha_rew if reward[trial] > 0 else alpha_pun

        # Update Stage 1 MF value (TD(0))
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += current_alpha * delta_stage1
        
        # Update Stage 2 MF value
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += current_alpha * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Stage-Specific Learning Rates
This model proposes that learning happens at different speeds for the high-level decision (Spaceships) versus the low-level decision (Aliens). It decouples the learning rate into `lr_stage1` and `lr_stage2`. This captures the possibility that a participant might be quick to update their preferences for specific aliens but slow to update their preferences for the spaceships leading to them (or vice versa).

```python

### Model 3: TD(1) Hybrid Model (Direct Reinforcement of Stage 1)
Standard hybrid models often use TD(0) for the Model-Free component, updating Stage 1 values based on the *expected* value of Stage 2. This model implements a TD(1)-like logic (or eligibility trace $\lambda=1$) for the Model-Free component. This means the Stage 1 choice is updated directly by the final reward obtained, bypassing the Stage 2 value estimate. This represents a simpler, more direct association between the spaceship choice and the coin.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    TD(1) Hybrid Model.

    learning_rate: [0,1] - Global learning rate.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
