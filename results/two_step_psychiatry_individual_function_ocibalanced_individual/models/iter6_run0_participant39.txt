Here are three new cognitive models following the specified constraints and building upon the two-step task structure.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Separate Learning Rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2
This model assumes that the participant might learn about the value of the spaceships (Stage 1) at a different rate than they learn about the value of the aliens (Stage 2). While standard models often use a single learning rate, this model tests if the "abstract" choice of a spaceship is updated differently from the "concrete" choice of an alien. It combines Model-Based and Model-Free values using a weighting parameter `w`.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Separate Learning Rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2.

    Bounds:
    alpha1: [0, 1] - Learning rate for stage 1 (spaceship) values.
    alpha2: [0, 1] - Learning rate for stage 2 (alien) values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting parameter (0 = pure Model-Free, 1 = pure Model-Based).
    """
    alpha1, alpha2, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))

```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free with "Forgetting" (Decay) on Unchosen Options
This model posits that the participant is purely Model-Free (no transition matrix knowledge) but has a memory decay mechanism. Values of actions *not* chosen decay back toward a neutral value (0.5). This captures the idea that if you don't visit an alien or fly a spaceship for a while, your confidence in its value diminishes or resets.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    forgetting or uncertainty growing over time for unvisited states.
    
    Bounds:

### Model 3: Model-Based with Stage 2 Temperature Scaling
This model assumes the participant is purely Model-Based (using the transition structure), but their decision noise (exploration) differs between the high-level spaceship choice and the low-level alien choice. A second beta parameter (`beta_2`) is introduced specifically for the second stage. This tests if the participant is more deterministic in one stage than the other.
