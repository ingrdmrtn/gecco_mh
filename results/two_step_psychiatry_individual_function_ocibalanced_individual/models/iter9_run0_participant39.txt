Here are three new cognitive models that introduce distinct mechanisms for learning and decision-making in the two-step task, avoiding the exact parameter combinations previously explored.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Separate Learning Rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns the value of the first-stage actions (spaceships) at a different speed than the second-stage actions (aliens). This is cognitively plausible if the participant views the spaceship choice as a stable "context" choice and the alien choice as a rapidly changing "reward" choice. It combines Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) systems using a weighting parameter `w`.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with separate learning rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2.
    
    This model assumes the participant updates their valuation of the spaceships (Stage 1)
    at a different rate (alpha1) than they update their valuation of the aliens (Stage 2, alpha2).
    It mixes Model-Based and Model-Free values using a weighting parameter w.

    Bounds:
    alpha1: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Stage 1 (MF).
    alpha2: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Stage 2 (MF).
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting between Model-Based (1) and Model-Free (0) control.
    """
    alpha1, alpha2, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)     # MF values for spaceships
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # MF values for aliens

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Model-Based Value: Transition prob * max(Stage 2 Value)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Hybrid Value
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf

        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # --- Updates ---
        # Stage 1 MF Update (using alpha1)
        # Note: Standard TD(0) update for Stage 1 looks at the value of the state arrived at (q_stage2_mf)

        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += alpha2 * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Free with Eligibility Traces (TD(lambda))
This model abandons the Model-Based component entirely to focus on how rewards propagate backward in time. It uses an eligibility trace parameter (`lambda_eligibility`) to determine how much the reward received at the second stage updates the value of the first-stage choice directly. This tests the hypothesis that the participant is purely associative but links rewards to past actions effectively.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Free TD(lambda) learning.
    
    This model does not use the transition matrix. Instead, it uses an eligibility trace
    to update Stage 1 values based on the final reward outcome, bypassing the intermediate state value.
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Standard learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    lambda_eligibility: [0, 1] - Decay factor for eligibility traces (0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo).

        # Note: In SARSA/TD, this is often Q(s', a') - Q(s, a). Here we use Q(s', a') as the target.

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive vs Negative) with Model-Based Weighting
This model investigates if the participant learns differently from gains (finding gold) versus losses (finding nothing). It splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg` but retains the hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free structure (`w`). This is crucial in psychiatry as some populations are hypersensitive to negative feedback or hyposensitive to positive feedback.
