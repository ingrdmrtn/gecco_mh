Here is the simulation code corresponding to the `cognitive_model1` (Pure Model-Free TD Learner) provided.

```python
import numpy as np

    """
    Simulates choices and rewards using the Pure Model-Free TD Learner.
    
    This model updates values based on Temporal Difference (TD) learning
    without using a transition matrix for planning.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, elig_trace]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
