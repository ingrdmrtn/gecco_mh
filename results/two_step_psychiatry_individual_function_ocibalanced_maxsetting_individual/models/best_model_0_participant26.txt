def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based Learner with Outcome-Dependent Stickiness.
    
    This model assumes the participant uses a Model-Based strategy (calculating
    expected values using the fixed transition matrix) but exhibits different
    perseveration (stickiness) biases depending on whether the previous trial
    resulted in a reward or not. This allows capturing behaviors like 
    'Win-Switch' (negative stick_win) or 'Loss-Stay' (positive stick_loss).
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Stage 2 alien values.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 choice.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2 choice.
    - stick_win: [-5, 5] Bias added to the previous Stage 1 choice if it was rewarded.
    - stick_loss: [-5, 5] Bias added to the previous Stage 1 choice if it was unrewarded.
