Here are three cognitive models formulated as Python functions to explain the participant's behavior in the two-step task.

### Cognitive Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free
This model posits that the participant uses a combination of two distinct strategies: a Model-Based (MB) strategy that plans using the transition structure, and a Model-Free (MF) strategy that learns habitual values from reward history. A mixing weight `w` determines the balance between these systems. This addresses the data pattern where the participant sometimes exploits rare transitions (MB) but also shows habitual behavior (MF).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid learner that combines Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) values.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule (higher = more deterministic).
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter. 0 = Pure Model-Free, 1 = Pure Model-Based.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    
    # Transition probabilities: A(0)->X(0) is 0.7, U(1)->Y(1) is 0.7
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Initialize Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # Model-free values for spaceships
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Model-free values for aliens (State x Alien)
    
    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # Model-Based Value: Expected max value of next stage weighted by transition probs

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Cognitive Model 2: Model-Based with Perseverance
This model assumes the participant is fundamentally Model-Based (calculating spaceship values based on alien values and transition probabilities) but exhibits "perseverance" or stickiness. They have a tendency to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of reward, capturing the long strings of repeated spaceship choices seen in the data (e.g., trials 121-132).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Based learner with a perseverance (stickiness) bonus for the previously chosen spaceship.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which second-stage Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - perseverance: [0, 5] Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen spaceship.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, perseverance = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))

```

### Cognitive Model 3: Model-Free with Eligibility Traces (TD-Lambda)
This model assumes the participant does not use the transition matrix at all (Pure Model-Free). However, it uses an eligibility trace parameter (`lambda`) to allow the reward obtained at the second stage to directly reinforce the first stage choice. This explains behavior where the participant repeats a successful spaceship choice even if it resulted from a rare transition (as seen in trials 44-45).

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free learner with eligibility traces (TD-lambda).
    Allows stage 2 reward to directly update stage 1 choice.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - lam: [0, 1] Eligibility trace parameter (lambda). 0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, lam = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
