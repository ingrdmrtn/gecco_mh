Here are three cognitive models expressed as Python functions. They are designed to capture different hypotheses about how the participant balances model-based planning, model-free reinforcement learning, and behavioral biases like perseverance.

### Model 1: Hybrid Reinforcement Learning with Eligibility Trace
This model assumes the participant uses a weighted combination of Model-Based (MB) planning (using the transition matrix) and Model-Free (MF) learning. It includes an eligibility trace parameter ($\lambda$) which determines how much the reward at the second stage directly reinforces the first stage choice, essentially bridging the time gap between choice and reward.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free RL with Eligibility Traces.
    
    This model assumes the participant combines:
    1. A Model-Based value (planning using the 70/30 transition matrix).
    2. A Model-Free value (learned from direct experience).
    
    Parameters:
    lr: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 choice (exploration/exploitation).
    beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2 choice.
    w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter. 0 = Pure Model-Free, 1 = Pure Model-Based.
    lam: [0, 1] Eligibility trace (lambda). Controls how much stage 2 reward affects stage 1 value.

    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid RL with Choice Perseverance (Stickiness)
The participant data shows significant "runs" where they repeat the same spaceship choice (e.g., trials 13-17, 147-152) even when rewards are intermittent. This model adds a "stickiness" parameter. It posits that the participant has a bias to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice, regardless of the reward outcome, which is a common phenomenon in this specific task.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid RL with Choice Perseverance (Stickiness).
    
    Adds a 'stickiness' parameter to the standard hybrid model. This accounts for
    the participant's tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 action regardless of 
    reward history (motor perseverance or cognitive inertia).
    
    Parameters:
    lr: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1.
    beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2.

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rate (Optimism/Pessimism)
The participant data suggests they might react differently to rewards (coins) versus omissions (0 coins). For instance, they often stick with a choice after a reward, but take several failures to switch. This model implements separate learning rates for positive prediction errors ($\alpha_{pos}$) and negative prediction errors ($\alpha_{neg}$).

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free RL with Asymmetric Learning Rates.

    (finding gold) versus negative outcomes (no gold). 
    It assumes a primarily Model-Free strategy (w is omitted/assumed 0 for parsimony, 
    or could be fixed, but here we focus on the split alpha).
    
    Parameters:
    alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate when prediction error is positive (better than expected).
    alpha_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate when prediction error is negative (worse than expected).
    beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1.
    beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2.
