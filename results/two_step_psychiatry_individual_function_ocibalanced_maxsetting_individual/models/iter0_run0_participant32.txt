Here are three cognitive models formulated as Python functions, based on the participant data and the two-step task structure.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free (MB/MF)
This model assumes the participant uses a combination of two distinct strategies: a Model-Based strategy (planning using the transition matrix) and a Model-Free strategy (habitual repetition of rewarded actions). The parameter `w` controls the balance between these systems. This addresses the data pattern where the participant sometimes switches after rare rewards (MB behavior) but other times repeats choices (MF behavior).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning Model.
    
    Combines a Model-Based (MB) valuation, which computes values using the 
    transition matrix and Stage 2 values, with a Model-Free (MF) valuation, 
    which updates Stage 1 values based on direct reinforcement.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter. 1 = Pure MB, 0 = Pure MF.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Stage 2: MF values (values of aliens) - used by both systems

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Based with Perseveration
This model assumes the participant understands the task structure perfectly (Pure Model-Based) but has a tendency to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of value (Perseveration). This accounts for the "streaks" observed in the data (e.g., choosing Spaceship 1 repeatedly) which might otherwise look like Model-Free habits, but separates "stickiness" from "learning".

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    Assumes Stage 1 values are derived entirely from the transition matrix and 
    Stage 2 values (no MF caching for Stage 1). Adds a 'stickiness' parameter 
    to account for motor perseveration or cognitive inertia.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Stage 2 (Alien) values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rate Model-Free (TD(1))
This model ignores the transition structure (Pure Model-Free) but posits that the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (finding gold) versus negative outcomes (no gold). The participant data suggests they stick with a winning strategy for long periods (high positive learning or retention) but may switch strategies quickly upon failure.

    Parameters:
    - lr_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate when reward is received (1).
