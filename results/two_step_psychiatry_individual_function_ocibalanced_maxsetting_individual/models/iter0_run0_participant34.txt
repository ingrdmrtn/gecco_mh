Here are three cognitive models implemented as Python functions. They are designed to capture different strategies (Model-Based, Model-Free, Hybrid) and specific behavioral characteristics (perseveration, asymmetric learning, eligibility traces) observed in the participant data.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Choice Stickiness
This model assumes the participant uses a combination of Model-Based (planning based on transition structure) and Model-Free (learning from direct experience) strategies. Crucially, it includes a "stickiness" parameter, as the participant data shows long "runs" of choosing the same spaceship (e.g., trials 51-63, 140-160) even when rewards fluctuate.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model (Model-Based + Model-Free) with Choice Stickiness.
    
    The agent computes a weighted average of Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) 
    values for the first stage. It also adds a 'stickiness' bonus to the previously 
    chosen action to account for the participant's tendency to repeat choices.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 softmax (exploration/exploitation).
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2 softmax.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter. 1 = Pure MB, 0 = Pure MF.
    - stickiness: [0, 5] Bonus added to the value of the previously chosen action.

### Model 2: Asymmetric Model-Free Learning
The participant reacts quickly to the loss at trial 12 (switching aliens) but sometimes persists with a spaceship choice despite losses. This model suggests the participant is purely Model-Free (habitual) but learns differently from positive outcomes (Reward=1) versus negative outcomes (Reward=0). This asymmetry can drive risk-seeking or risk-averse behavior.

import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    and negative prediction errors (worse than expected).

    - lr_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate when prediction error is positive.
    - lr_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate when prediction error is negative.

```

### Model 3: TD(Lambda) Eligibility Trace
This model is a Model-Free learner that uses an "eligibility trace" (lambda). In a standard TD learner, the outcome at Stage 2 only directly updates Stage 2 values, and Stage 1 values are updated based on Stage 2 values. With `lambda > 0`, the final reward "traces back" to directly reinforce the Stage 1 spaceship choice. This explains how the participant might strongly associate a specific spaceship with rewards, bypassing the complexity of the transition matrix.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Base learning rate.
    - lambda_param: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay. Controls how much Stage 2 reward affects Stage 1.
