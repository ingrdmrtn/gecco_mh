Here are three cognitive models based on the provided template and participant data.

### Cognitive Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free
This model posits that the participant combines both Model-Based (planning using the transition structure) and Model-Free (habitual caching of values) strategies. Given the participant's data shows some sensitivity to transitions but also long blocks of repetition, a weighting parameter `w` controls the balance between the planning system (`q_stage1_mb`) and the habit system (`q_stage1_mf`).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Learner.
    
    The agent computes Stage 1 values as a weighted combination of:
    1. Model-Based (MB): Uses the known transition matrix and max Stage 2 values.
    2. Model-Free (MF): Uses TD-learning from direct experience.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 choice (exploration/exploitation).
    beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2 choice.
    w: [0, 1] Mixing weight. 1 = Pure MB, 0 = Pure MF.
    """
    learning_rate, beta_1, beta_2, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)

        # Calculate Model-Based value
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Combine MB and MF values

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Cognitive Model 2: Pure Model-Free with Eligibility Traces
The participant data shows long "streaks" of choices (e.g., sticking with Spaceship 0 for trials 44-127). This behavior is characteristic of Model-Free reinforcement learning where the final reward strongly reinforces the initial choice. This model ignores the transition structure (Model-Based component) entirely. Instead, it uses an eligibility trace parameter (`lambda`) to allow the final reward prediction error (`delta_stage2`) to directly update the Stage 1 value, reinforcing the full chain of actions.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Eligibility Traces (TD-Lambda).

    It updates Stage 1 values based on both the Stage 2 value (TD-0)
    and the final reward outcome via an eligibility trace.

    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 choice.
    beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2 choice.

### Cognitive Model 3: Model-Based with Choice Stickiness (Perseveration)
The participant exhibits extreme "stickiness" (perseveration), staying with one spaceship for nearly 100 trials despite fluctuating rewards. This model assumes the participant is fundamentally Model-Based (calculating values based on the tree structure) but has a strong heuristic bias to repeat the previous action (`stickiness`). This accounts for the inertia observed in the data better than simple learning rates.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    The agent calculates Stage 1 values using the transition matrix (Model-Based).
    However, a 'stickiness' bonus is added to the previously chosen action,
    making the agent prone to repeating choices regardless of value.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Stage 2 Q-values are updated.
    beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1.
    beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2.
