Here are three cognitive models based on the participant data and the two-step task structure.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
This model hypothesizes that the participant combines two distinct strategies: a **Model-Free (MF)** strategy that reinforces actions based on direct reward history, and a **Model-Based (MB)** strategy that computes values using the known transition structure (Spaceship $\to$ Planet) and the learned values of the aliens. A mixing weight parameter $w$ controls the balance between these systems. This fits the data where the participant shows sensitivity to transition structure (switching after rare transitions rewarded) but also some habitual behavior.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free learner with eligibility traces.
    
    The agent computes Stage 1 values as a weighted combination of:
    1. Model-Based value: Calculated from transition matrix * max(Stage 2 values).
    2. Model-Free value: Learned via TD-error from Stage 2.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (softmax randomness). Higher = more deterministic.
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight. 1 = Pure Model-Based, 0 = Pure Model-Free.
    - lam: [0, 1] Eligibility trace (lambda). How much Stage 2 reward affects Stage 1 value directly.

```

### Model 2: Pure Model-Based with Perseverance
The participant data shows long streaks of repeating the same spaceship choice (e.g., Trials 5-12, 137-140). This model assumes the participant is fundamentally **Model-Based** (calculating spaceship value based on alien values) but suffers from **Perseverance (Stickiness)**. They have a tendency to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of the reward, captured by a parameter $p$. This separates "habit" (repeating action) from "learning" (value update).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based learner with Choice Perseverance (Stickiness).
    
    The agent calculates Stage 1 values purely via the transition structure (Model-Based).
    However, the decision is biased by a 'stickiness' factor that increases the 
    probability of repeating the previous trial's Stage 1 choice.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Stage 2 Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - perseverance: [0, 5] Bonus added to the logit of the previously chosen action.

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rate Hybrid Model
This model is a variation of the Hybrid model that accounts for **Risk Asymmetry**. Participants often learn differently from positive outcomes (finding gold) versus negative outcomes (finding nothing). This model uses two separate learning rates: $\alpha_{pos}$ for rewarded trials and $\alpha_{neg}$ for unrewarded trials. This helps explain behaviors where the participant might be slow to abandon a high-value option after one failure, or conversely, very quick to switch after a loss.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid learner with Asymmetric Learning Rates (Positive vs Negative).

    Parameters:
    - alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate when Reward = 1.
    - alpha_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate when Reward = 0.
