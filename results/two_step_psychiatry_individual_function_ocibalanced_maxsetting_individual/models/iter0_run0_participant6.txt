Here are three cognitive models implemented as Python functions, designed to explain the two-step decision-making behavior of the participant.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
This model posits that the participant uses a combination of two strategies: a Model-Based (MB) strategy that plans using the transition structure (70%/30%) of the task, and a Model-Free (MF) strategy that learns simple action-reward associations. A mixing parameter `w` controls the balance between these strategies. This is the standard theoretical model for this specific task.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free learner with eligibility traces.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 choice (exploration/exploitation).
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2 choice.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter. 1 = Pure Model-Based, 0 = Pure Model-Free.
    - lambda_eligibility: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay. Controls how much Stage 2 outcome updates Stage 1 MF values.

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))

### Model 2: Model-Free Learning with Choice Perseverance
The participant data shows long streaks of choosing the same spaceship (e.g., trials 28-40, 150-200). This suggests "stickiness" or perseverance. This model ignores the complex transition matrix (Pure Model-Free) but adds a `stickiness` parameter. If the participant chose Spaceship A last time, Spaceship A gets a value bonus in the next trial, regardless of reward.

```

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rate Hybrid Model
Participants often weigh positive outcomes (finding gold) differently from negative outcomes (finding nothing). This model extends the Hybrid model by splitting the learning rate into `alpha_pos` (for rewards) and `alpha_neg` (for non-rewards). This can explain behavior where a participant is quick to learn a good option but slow to discard it when it stops paying out (or vice versa).

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    - alpha_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate when Reward <= 0.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature Stage 1.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature Stage 2.
