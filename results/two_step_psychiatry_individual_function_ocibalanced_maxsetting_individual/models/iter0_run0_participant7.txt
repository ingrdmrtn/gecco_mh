Here are the three cognitive models based on the participant data and the two-step task structure.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free with Eligibility Traces
This model assumes the participant uses a combination of Model-Based (planning using the transition structure) and Model-Free (trial-and-error) strategies. It includes an eligibility trace parameter ($\lambda$) which allows the reward at the second stage to directly influence the value of the first stage choice, bridging the gap between the two steps.

```python

    - beta_2: Inverse temperature for Stage 2 softmax [0, 10]
    - w: Mixing weight between Model-Based and Model-Free values (0=MF, 1=MB) [0, 1]

    for trial in range(n_trials):

    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model with Choice Perseveration
The participant data shows long "streaks" of choosing the same spaceship (e.g., trials 27-41). This suggests "perseveration" or "stickiness"—a tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of the reward. This model adds a `stickiness` parameter to the Stage 1 choice policy.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Asymmetric Learning Rates
Participants often update their beliefs differently following positive outcomes (rewards) versus negative outcomes (omissions). This model splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg` to capture potential biases in how the participant processes wins versus losses.

    - beta_1: Inverse temperature for Stage 1 softmax [0, 10]
