Here are the three cognitive models based on the participant's data.

The participant data shows distinct "blocks" of choices (e.g., choosing Spaceship 0 for 20+ trials, then Spaceship 1 for 40+ trials) rather than trial-by-trial switching. This indicates high **perseveration** (stickiness). The models below incorporate this behavior while exploring different mechanisms for value learning (Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free, Eligibility Traces, and Asymmetric Learning).

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free with Perseveration
This model hypothesizes that the participant combines a Model-Based (MB) planning strategy (using the transition matrix) with a Model-Free (MF) habit strategy. Crucially, it adds a "stickiness" parameter to account for the participant's tendency to repeat Stage 1 choices regardless of the outcome.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free learner with Choice Perseveration.
    
    This model assumes the participant's choice is a weighted mixture of:
    1. A Model-Based system (using the transition matrix).
    2. A Model-Free system (TD learning).
    3. A perseveration bonus (stickiness) for repeating the previous choice.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta_1: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for Stage 1 softmax (exploration/exploitation).
    beta_2: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for Stage 2 softmax.
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (1 = Pure Model-Based, 0 = Pure Model-Free).
    stickiness: [0,5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.

### Model 2: Model-Free TD($\lambda$) with Stickiness
This model ignores the transition structure (Pure Model-Free) but uses an eligibility trace parameter ($\lambda$). This allows the reward received at Stage 2 to directly influence the value of the Stage 1 choice. Given the participant's block-like data, the stickiness parameter is retained to explain why they don't switch immediately after losses.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    prediction error back to update the Stage 1 choice directly.

    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta_1: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for Stage 1.
    beta_2: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for Stage 2.

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rate (Pos/Neg) with Stickiness
The participant often stays with a spaceship even after receiving 0 coins (e.g., trials 21, 23, 27, 28). This suggests they might learn differently from positive outcomes (Reward=1) versus negative outcomes (Reward=0). This model splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`.

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Asymmetric Model-Free learner (Positive vs Negative Learning Rates).
    
    This model tests if the participant learns differently from rewards (1) 
    vs omissions (0). This can explain why they might persist in a choice 
    despite lack of reward (low negative learning rate) or switch rapidly.

    Parameters:
    lr_pos: [0,1] - Learning rate when Prediction Error is positive (better than expected).
    lr_neg: [0,1] - Learning rate when Prediction Error is negative (worse than expected).
