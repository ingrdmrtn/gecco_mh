Here are three cognitive models based on the participant data and the two-step task structure.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Choice Stickiness
This model posits that the participant combines Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) value estimates. Crucially, based on the "runs" of identical choices in the data (e.g., trials 54-58, 113-117), it includes a **stickiness** parameter (perseveration) that biases the participant to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of reward history.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free learner with Choice Stickiness.
    
    Explains the participant's tendency to repeat choices (perseveration) 
    even after non-rewarded trials.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Rate of updating Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation balance).
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    stickiness: [0,5] - Bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) # Model-free values for stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Model-free values for stage 2 (2 states, 2 actions)
    
    prev_action_1 = -1

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- STAGE 1 POLICY ---
        # Model-Based value calculation: Transition * Max(Stage 2 Values)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model with Asymmetric Learning Rates
The data contains rewards of 1, 0, and -1. Participants often update value estimates differently for positive outcomes (confirmation) versus negative outcomes (disconfirmation). This model splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` (for positive prediction errors) and `alpha_neg` (for negative prediction errors).

import numpy as np

    lr_neg: [0,1] - Learning rate when prediction error is negative.

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Eligibility Trace (Lambda)
This model implements a "TD($\lambda$)" mechanism. In pure Model-Free learning, the Stage 1 choice is usually only updated by the transition to Stage 2. However, with an eligibility trace `lambda`, the final reward outcome is allowed to directly update the Stage 1 choice that preceded it. This captures the temporal credit assignment problem often seen in human data, where a final reward reinforces the initial spaceship choice directly.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
