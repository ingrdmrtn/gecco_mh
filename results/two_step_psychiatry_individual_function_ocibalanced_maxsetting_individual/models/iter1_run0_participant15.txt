Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task.

### Model 1: Dual-Alpha Hybrid Model
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns at different rates for the two stages of the task. While the "Hybrid" architecture (mixing Model-Free and Model-Based) is standard, this version decouples the learning rate for the high-level spaceship choice (`alpha_1`) from the low-level alien choice (`alpha_2`). This allows the model to capture scenarios where a participant might be quick to learn which alien is currently rich (high `alpha_2`) but slow to update their habitual preference for spaceships (low `alpha_1`), or vice versa.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Dual Learning Rates.
    
    This model combines Model-Free (MF) and Model-Based (MB) strategies.
    It uses separate learning rates for the Stage 1 MF update (associating 
    spaceships directly with rewards via TD(1)) and the Stage 2 value update 
    (learning alien values). This captures potential differences in learning 
    speed between the abstract high-level choice and the concrete outcome.
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_1: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1 MF values.
    - alpha_2: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 values.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 choices.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2 choices.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    - stickiness: [0, 5] Choice stickiness for Stage 1.

### Model 2: Model-Based RL with Choice Kernel (Habit)
The participant data shows long "blocks" of repeating the same spaceship choice (e.g., trials 15-51, 62-87). A simple 1-back stickiness parameter might not capture this momentum well. This model replaces simple stickiness with a "Choice Kernel"—a decaying memory of past choices. This represents a "habit" strength that builds up with repetition and decays slowly, competing with or aiding the Goal-Directed (Model-Based) system.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Based RL with Choice Kernel (Habit).
    
    This model assumes the participant uses a Model-Based strategy for value 
    estimation, but their Stage 1 choices are heavily influenced by a "Choice Kernel" 
    (habit). Unlike simple stickiness, the choice kernel accumulates over time 
    and decays, capturing the momentum seen in the participant's long streaks 
    of repeating the same spaceship.
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 alien values.
    - beta_mb: [0, 10] Weight (inverse temp) for Model-Based values in Stage 1.
    - beta_habit: [0, 10] Weight for the Choice Kernel (Habit) in Stage 1.
    - alpha_k: [0, 1] Decay rate for the Choice Kernel (higher = faster decay).
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2.

```

### Model 3: Model-Based RL with Counterfactual Updating
This model tests the hypothesis that the participant engages in "fictitious play" or counterfactual reasoning. When they choose an alien and receive a reward (0 or 1), they not only update the chosen alien but also update the *unchosen* alien as if it had yielded the opposite result (1 - reward). This reflects a belief structure where the participant assumes the two aliens on a planet are anti-correlated (i.e., if one has gold, the other doesn't).

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):

    they update the value of the *unchosen* alien as if they had received 
    the opposite outcome (1 - reward). This reflects a belief that the aliens 
    are anti-correlated (e.g. "If this one gave me nothing, the other one 
    must have the coin").
