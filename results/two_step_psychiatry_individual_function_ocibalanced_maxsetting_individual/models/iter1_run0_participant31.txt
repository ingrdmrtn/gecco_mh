Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step decision task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Agent with Q-value Decay
This model introduces a **decay parameter** (forgetting) for the second stage. Since the reward probabilities of the aliens drift slowly over time, older Q-values for unchosen aliens may become inaccurate. This model assumes that the value of unvisited options decays (e.g., toward zero), reflecting increasing uncertainty or a pessimistic prior about unobserved rewards.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Agent with Q-value Decay.
    
    Incorporates a forgetting mechanism for Stage 2 Q-values. Unchosen aliens' 
    values decay toward 0 on each trial, helping the agent adapt to the 
    drifting reward probabilities by suppressing stale information.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for chosen actions.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (MB vs MF).
    - decay_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which unchosen Q-values decay (0 = no decay).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w, decay_rate = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

        unchosen_action_2 = 1 - action_2[trial]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, unchosen_action_2] *= (1 - decay_rate)

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Agent with Separate Learning Rates
This model distinguishes between the learning dynamics of the two stages. The first stage (choosing a spaceship) involves learning about stable transition structures and distal rewards, while the second stage (choosing an alien) involves tracking rapidly changing reward probabilities. By using **separate learning rates**, the model can update its immediate reward expectations (Stage 2) quickly without destabilizing its higher-level preferences (Stage 1), or vice versa.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Agent with Separate Learning Rates.
    
    Uses distinct learning rates for Stage 1 (spaceships) and Stage 2 (aliens).
    This allows the model to track the drifting alien reward probabilities 
    at a different speed than it updates the values of the spaceships.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr_stage1: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1 updates.
    - lr_stage2: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.

### Model 3: Hybrid Agent with Eligibility Traces and Stickiness
This model combines two powerful mechanisms identified in previous iterations. It uses **eligibility traces (`lam`)** to allow the final reward prediction error to directly update the Stage 1 choice (bridging the gap between action and outcome), and **stickiness** to account for the tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 motor action regardless of value. This combination captures both efficient credit assignment and behavioral inertia.
