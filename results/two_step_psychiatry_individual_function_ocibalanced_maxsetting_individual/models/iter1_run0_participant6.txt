Here are three cognitive models implemented as Python functions, designed to explain the participant's behavior in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free with Stickiness
This model hypothesizes that the participant combines a Model-Based (planning) strategy with a Model-Free (habitual) strategy, while also exhibiting a tendency to repeat previous choices (stickiness). This addresses the "Full Hybrid" theory (Daw et al., 2011) which was not fully explored in the previous attempts, specifically combining the weighting parameter $w$ with perseverance.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free learner with Choice Perseverance (Stickiness).
    
    This model assumes the agent computes values using both a planning approach 
    (using the transition matrix) and a caching approach (learning from experience), 
    weighted by parameter w. It also includes a stickiness bonus for repeating choices.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which MF Q-values are updated.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    - stickiness: [0, 5] Bonus added to the value of the previously chosen Stage 1 action.

### Model 2: Asymmetric Model-Free Learning with Stickiness
This model investigates if the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (wins) versus negative outcomes (losses/omissions). Given the long streaks of behavior in the data, the participant might be highly sensitive to rewards (reinforcement) but less sensitive to lack of rewards, or vice versa.

### Model 3: Model-Free with Decay (Forgetting) and Stickiness
The reward probabilities in this task drift slowly over time. A standard Q-learner might get "stuck" with an old low value for an option that has since become good. This model adds a "forgetting" or "decay" parameter, where unchosen options slowly revert to a neutral value (or zero), allowing for re-exploration.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Value Decay (Forgetting) and Stickiness.
    
    This model assumes that the values of unchosen actions 'decay' over time.
    This helps the agent track non-stationary reward probabilities (drifting bandits)
    by reducing the confidence in old estimates of unvisited states.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for chosen actions.
    - decay_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which unchosen Q-values decay toward 0.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1.
