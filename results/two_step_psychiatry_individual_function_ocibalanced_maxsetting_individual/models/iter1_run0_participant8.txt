Here are the 3 new cognitive models based on the participant's behavior and the provided template.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free with Asymmetric Learning
**Rationale:** The previous best model suggested the participant learns differently from positive and negative prediction errors (Asymmetric MF). However, the task is specifically designed to test for Model-Based (planning) strategies. This model combines the **Asymmetric Learning** mechanism with a **Hybrid (MB/MF)** architecture. It posits that the participant uses both planning (MB) and habit (MF), but updates their value estimates asymmetrically (e.g., ignoring losses or over-weighting gains) within those systems.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free learner with Asymmetric Learning Rates.
    
    Combines a weighted mix of Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habit) 
    values. Crucially, it updates value estimates using different learning 
    rates for positive vs negative prediction errors.

    Parameters:
    lr_pos: [0,1] - Learning rate for positive Prediction Errors (better than expected).
    lr_neg: [0,1] - Learning rate for negative Prediction Errors (worse than expected).
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature (randomness) for both stages.
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    stickiness: [0,5] - Choice perseveration bonus for Stage 1.

### Model 2: Model-Free with Value Decay (Forgetting)
**Rationale:** The participant exhibits "blocky" behavior, sticking to one spaceship for ~50 trials before switching. A standard RL model keeps the value of the unchosen option constant. In reality, memory traces decay. If the participant ignores Spaceship U for 50 trials, its value might decay toward zero (or a baseline), effectively "forgetting" how good or bad it was. This **Decay** parameter allows the unchosen action's value to erode, potentially facilitating a switch when the current option's payout drops.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    Standard Q-learning, but the Q-value of the UNCHOSEN action in Stage 1 
    decays towards 0 on every trial. This simulates forgetting the value 
    of options that are not explored.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Standard learning rate for chosen actions.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    stickiness: [0,5] - Choice perseveration bonus.
    decay_rate: [0,1] - Rate at which unchosen Stage 1 Q-values decay to 0.

    learning_rate, beta, stickiness, decay_rate = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

### Model 3: Split-Stage Learning Rates (Stage 1 vs Stage 2)
**Rationale:** The participant might be learning the "bandit" task (which alien gives gold) at a different speed than the "navigation" task (which spaceship to take). By separating `lr_stage1` and `lr_stage2`, this model captures the possibility that the participant updates their spaceship preferences slowly (leading to the observed persistence/stickiness) while updating their alien preferences quickly (or vice versa).

import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
