Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task.

### Cognitive Model 1
**Model-Free RL with Eligibility Traces and Choice Kernel**
This model extends the Model-Free framework by adding two mechanisms:
1.  **Eligibility Traces (`lambda_eligibility`)**: Allows the outcome at Stage 2 to directly update the value of the Stage 1 choice, bridging the temporal gap.
2.  **Choice Kernel (`ck_decay`, `ck_weight`)**: A sophisticated "habit" mechanism that tracks a decaying history of past choices, rather than just the last choice (perseveration). This helps explain the long streaks in the participant's data.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Eligibility Traces and Choice Kernel.
    
    Combines SARSA(lambda) for temporal difference learning with a Choice Kernel
    to capture perseveration (autocorrelation) in Stage 1 choices.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 choices.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2 choices.
    - lambda_eligibility: [0, 1] Decay factor for eligibility traces (credit assignment).
    - ck_decay: [0, 1] Decay rate of the choice kernel (stickiness trace).
    - ck_weight: [0, 10] Weight of the choice kernel in the decision.
    """
    learning_rate, beta_1, beta_2, lambda_eligibility, ck_decay, ck_weight = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    
    q_stage1 = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2)) # state x action
    choice_kernel = np.zeros(2)

    for t in range(n_trials):
        a1 = int(action_1[t])
        s2 = int(state[t])
        a2 = int(action_2[t])
        r = int(reward[t])
        
        # Stage 1 Choice
        # Decision is based on Q-values plus the Choice Kernel habit strength

        log_likelihood += np.log(probs_2[a2] + eps)
        
        # Value Updates (SARSA(lambda))
        # Delta 1: difference between Stage 2 value and Stage 1 value

        # Update Stage 2
        q_stage2[s2, a2] += learning_rate * delta_2
        
    return -log_likelihood
```

### Cognitive Model 2
**Hybrid Model with Separate Learning Rates**
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns about the spaceships (Stage 1) and the aliens (Stage 2) at different speeds. By decoupling `alpha_1` and `alpha_2`, the model can capture behavior where the agent is slow to change spaceship preferences (explaining streaks) but quick to adapt to alien rewards, or vice versa. It includes simple perseveration.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Separate Learning Rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2.

    than the value of aliens (Stage 2). Includes simple perseveration.

### Cognitive Model 3
**Hybrid Model with Choice Kernel**
This model combines Model-Based planning with the Choice Kernel mechanism. Unlike simple perseveration (which only looks at the previous trial), the Choice Kernel builds up a "momentum" or habit strength over many trials. This tests if the participant balances goal-directed (MB) behavior with a strong, accumulated habit.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate of Q-value updating.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2.
    - w_mb: [0, 1] Weight of Model-Based values.

    - ck_weight: [0, 10] Weight of choice kernel in Stage 1 decision.
