Here are three cognitive models based on the participant data and the provided template.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free with Stickiness
**Hypothesis:** The participant likely uses a combination of Model-Based (planning based on transition probabilities) and Model-Free (habitual) strategies. Given the long streaks of repeated choices in the data, a "stickiness" parameter is added to the hybrid formulation to account for choice perseveration, which was missing in the previously tested `learning_rate, beta, w` combination.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Stickiness.
    
    Combines goal-directed planning (MB) with habitual learning (MF).
    Adds a stickiness parameter to account for choice perseveration.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Weight for prediction error updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    - stickiness: [0, 5] Bonus added to repeating the previous Stage 1 choice.

        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Asymmetric Learning Rate with Stickiness
**Hypothesis:** Participants often weigh positive outcomes (finding gold) differently than negative outcomes (finding nothing). This model replaces the single learning rate with `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`. It retains `stickiness` (instead of eligibility traces `lam`) because the participant's data shows strong repetition bias, which is likely a stronger driver than the eligibility trace mechanism for this specific individual.

```

### Model 3: Model-Free with Eligibility Trace and Separate Stage Betas
**Hypothesis:** The decision dynamics for choosing a spaceship (abstract, repetitive) may differ from choosing an alien (concrete, immediate reward). This model allows for different levels of decision noise (`beta_1` vs `beta_2`) for the two stages, combined with an eligibility trace (`lam`) to link the second-stage outcome to the first-stage choice. This tests if the "stickiness" observed is actually just very low noise (high beta) in Stage 1 but higher noise in Stage 2.
