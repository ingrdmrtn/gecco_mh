Here are three new cognitive models based on the participant data and the feedback provided.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Memory Decay
This model hypothesizes that because the reward probabilities of the aliens drift slowly over time, the participant might "forget" or devalue older experiences. It introduces a `decay_rate` parameter. It uses a Hybrid architecture (mixing Model-Based and Model-Free values via `w`), but on every trial, unvisited Q-values (or all Q-values) decay slightly towards zero, allowing the model to adapt faster to the changing environment than standard Q-learning.

```python
import numpy as np

    """
    Hybrid Model with Memory Decay.
    
    Combines Model-Based and Model-Free reinforcement learning.
    Includes a 'decay_rate' parameter to model forgetting of Q-values 
    over time, appropriate for environments with drifting reward probabilities.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice (shared across stages).
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    decay_rate: [0,1] - Rate at which Q-values decay to 0 on each trial.

### Model 2: Hybrid Model with Separate Stage Learning Rates
This model suggests that the participant learns the transition structure/Stage 1 values at a different rate than the bandit-like Stage 2 values. Stage 1 involves predicting stable transitions (common vs. rare), while Stage 2 involves tracking rapidly drifting reward probabilities. By separating `alpha_stage1` and `alpha_stage2`, the model can capture these different timescales of learning within a Hybrid framework.

import numpy as np

### Model 3: Asymmetric Model-Free Learning with Choice Stickiness
Since the "best model so far" was Model-Free with Stickiness (and eligibility traces), and "Asymmetric Learning" was tried separately (with traces but without stickiness), this model combines **Asymmetric Learning** (learning differently from positive vs. negative prediction errors) with **Choice Stickiness** (perseveration). This assumes the participant has a bias towards repeating actions *and* a biological bias in how they process gains versus losses (e.g., dopamine D1/D2 pathways), without relying on model-based planning or eligibility traces.
