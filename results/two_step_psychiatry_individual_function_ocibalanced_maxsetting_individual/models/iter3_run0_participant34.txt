Here are three cognitive models expressed as Python functions. They explore different mechanisms for integrating Model-Based and Model-Free learning, specifically targeting the participant's persistence and reward-sensitivity patterns.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Eligibility Traces (Lambda)
This model implements the "full" reinforcement learning model often used for this task. It allows the Model-Free system to update the Stage 1 value not just based on the Stage 2 value (TD(0)), but also partially based on the final reward outcome (TD(1)), controlled by an eligibility trace parameter $\lambda$. This helps explain how the participant might reinforce Stage 1 choices directly from rewards, bypassing the model-based state structure.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Eligibility Traces (Lambda).
    
    Incorporates an eligibility trace parameter (lambda) that modulates how much 
    the Stage 1 Model-Free value is updated by the final reward (Stage 2 prediction error).
    This bridges the gap between TD(0) and Monte Carlo updating.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    - lambda_param: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay (0 = TD(0), 1 = Monte Carlo).
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    - stickiness: [0, 5] Choice stickiness for Stage 1 (repetition bias).

### Model 2: Hybrid Model with Reward-Dependent Stickiness
This model modifies the concept of "stickiness" (perseveration). Instead of a constant bias to repeat the last action, the stickiness parameter varies depending on whether the previous trial was rewarded or not. This captures "Win-Stay, Lose-Shift" dynamics explicitly within the choice policy, separate from value learning.

```python

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with Habit Trace
This model replaces the simple 1-step stickiness with a "Habit Trace". The trace accumulates over time for chosen actions and decays for all actions. This allows the model to capture longer-term habitual persistence (blocks of repeated choices) that simple stickiness cannot.

    longer than a single trial.

    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2.
