Here are three new cognitive models based on the participant's behavior, specifically addressing the strong perseveration in Stage 1 choices (spaceships) contrasted with the adaptive behavior in Stage 2 (aliens).

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with Stage-Specific Learning Rates
This model separates the learning rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2. The participant data shows long blocks of repeating the same spaceship choice (Stage 1) despite fluctuating outcomes, while seemingly learning the best alien (Stage 2) more rapidly. A single learning rate might not capture these two distinct timescales of adaptation.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Stage-Specific Learning Rates.
    
    Differentiates learning speeds between the spaceship choice (Stage 1)
    and the alien choice (Stage 2). This allows the model to capture 
    slow switching/high stability in the first stage while maintaining 
    rapid adaptation to changing reward probabilities in the second stage.

    Parameters:
    lr_1: [0,1] - Learning rate for Stage 1 (spaceships).
    lr_2: [0,1] - Learning rate for Stage 2 (aliens).
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature (shared).
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    stickiness: [0,5] - Choice perseveration bonus for Stage 1.
    """
    lr_1, lr_2, beta, w, stickiness = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    prev_a1 = -1

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        if prev_a1 != -1:
            q_net[prev_a1] += stickiness

        state_idx = state[trial]

        # policy for the second choice
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx, :])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] - q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]]
        
        # Action value updating for Choice 1 using lr_1
        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += lr_1 * delta_stage1
        
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        
        # Action value updating for Choice 2 using lr_2
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += lr_2 * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model with Eligibility Trace (Lambda)
This model introduces an eligibility trace parameter (`lam`). This parameter controls how much the final reward outcome (Stage 2) directly updates the Stage 1 choice value, effectively bridging the Model-Free update between the two stages. A low lambda might explain why the participant persists in Stage 1 choices even after receiving no rewards, as the credit assignment from the final outcome to the initial choice is dampened.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Eligibility Trace (Lambda).
    
    Incorporates an eligibility trace parameter (lambda) that allows the Stage 2 
    reward prediction error to directly update the Stage 1 choice value. 
    This modulates the credit assignment from the final reward back to the 
    initial spaceship choice, interpolating between TD(0) and TD(1).

    Parameters:
    lr: [0,1] - Learning rate.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0,1] - Weighting parameter (0 = Pure MF, 1 = Pure MB).
    lam: [0,1] - Eligibility trace parameter (0 = TD(0), 1 = TD(1)).

### Model 3: Full Hybrid Model with Stage-Specific Parameters
This model provides maximum flexibility by allowing both the learning rate and the inverse temperature (beta) to vary between Stage 1 and Stage 2. This tests the hypothesis that the participant operates in a "sticky, low-exploration" mode for spaceships (Stage 1) but a "high-learning, high-precision" mode for aliens (Stage 2).

```python

    This model assumes the decision process for selecting a spaceship (Stage 1) 
    differs fundamentally in both volatility and exploration/exploitation balance 
    from the decision for selecting an alien (Stage 2).

    Parameters:
    lr_1: [0,1] - Learning rate for Stage 1.
    lr_2: [0,1] - Learning rate for Stage 2.
