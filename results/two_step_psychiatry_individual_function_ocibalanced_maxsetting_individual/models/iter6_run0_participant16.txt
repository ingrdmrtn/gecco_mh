Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task, designed based on the participant's behavior and the previous model performance.

### Model 1: Model-Free RL with Asymmetric Learning, Separate Betas, and Eligibility Traces
This model extends the "best so far" model by introducing an eligibility trace parameter (`lam`). This allows the model to continuously interpolate between updating Stage 1 values based on the value of the state reached (TD(0)) and the final reward received (TD(1)/Monte Carlo). It retains asymmetric learning rates and separate inverse temperatures for each stage to capture the specific sensitivities observed.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free RL with TD(lambda) Eligibility Traces, Asymmetric Learning, and Separate Betas.
    
    Allows interpolation between updating Stage 1 based on Stage 2 values (TD0) 
    and final rewards (TD1), with asymmetric sensitivity to prediction errors.
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    - alpha_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate for negative prediction errors.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 choice.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2 choice.
    - lam: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay parameter (0 = TD(0), 1 = TD(1)).
    """
    alpha_pos, alpha_neg, beta_1, beta_2, lam = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1 = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2))

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model (MB+MF) with Asymmetric Learning and Separate Betas
This model combines Model-Based planning (using the known transition structure) with the robust asymmetric Model-Free learning found in previous iterations. By including separate betas and asymmetric alphas, it tests if the participant uses model-based information (`w`) when the noise and learning dynamics are properly accounted for by the other parameters.

### Model 3: Model-Free RL with Asymmetric Learning, Separate Betas, and Stickiness
This model investigates the role of choice perseveration (stickiness). It adds a "stickiness" parameter to the asymmetric, separate-beta MF model. This accounts for the participant's tendency to repeat choices regardless of reward history, which can often explain variance that pure Q-learning cannot.

    Parameters:
    - alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    - alpha_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate for negative prediction errors.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 choice.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2 choice.
