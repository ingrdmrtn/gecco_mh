Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task.

### Model 1: Outcome-Dependent Mixing Weight (W-Win/Loss)
This model hypothesizes that the participant's reliance on Model-Based (planning) versus Model-Free (habitual) strategies changes based on the outcome of the previous trial. For example, a "Win-Stay, Lose-Shift" strategy at the system level might imply sticking to habits (MF) after a win, but re-evaluating the structure (MB) after a loss.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Outcome-Dependent Mixing Weight (W-Win/Loss).
    
    The balance between Model-Based and Model-Free control (w) changes 
    depending on whether the previous trial was rewarded.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w_win: [0, 1] Mixing weight after a win.
    - w_loss: [0, 1] Mixing weight after a loss.
    - stick: [-5, 5] Stickiness bias.
    """
    lr, beta, w_win, w_loss, stick = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    last_reward = 0 # Assume loss/neutral start

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # Determine current mixing weight based on previous outcome

        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]
  
        # Update Stage 1 MF

### Model 2: Asymmetric Learning with Eligibility Traces
This model combines two powerful RL mechanisms:
1.  **Asymmetric Learning**: The participant learns differently from positive prediction errors (better than expected) versus negative ones (worse than expected).
2.  **Eligibility Traces (Lambda)**: The reward received in the second stage directly updates the value of the first-stage choice, bridging the temporal gap.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    - alpha_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate for negative prediction errors.

### Model 3: Mood-Based Learning (Asymmetric LR + Outcome-Dependent Beta)
This model proposes that the participant's "mood" (determined by recent wins/losses) affects both their **learning update** (via asymmetric learning rates) and their **decision noise** (via outcome-dependent beta). A win might trigger an optimistic, exploitative state, while a loss might trigger a pessimistic, explorative state.
