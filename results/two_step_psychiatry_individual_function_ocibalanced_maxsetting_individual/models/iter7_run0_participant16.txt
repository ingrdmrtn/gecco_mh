Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task.

### Model 1: Pure Model-Based RL with Asymmetric Stage 2 Learning
This model tests the hypothesis that the participant uses a **Model-Based** planning strategy (calculating spaceship values based on knowledge of transitions and alien values) but learns the values of the aliens (Stage 2) in an **asymmetric** way (different sensitivity to wins vs. losses). This separates the planning mechanism from the reward valuation mechanism.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Pure Model-Based RL with Asymmetric Stage 2 Learning.
    
    This model computes Stage 1 values based on the transition matrix and 
    current Stage 2 values (Planning). Stage 2 values are learned from experience,
    with separate learning rates for positive and negative rewards.
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 rewards (wins).
    - alpha_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 non-rewards (losses).
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 choice.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2 choice.

    alpha_pos, alpha_neg, beta_1, beta_2 = model_parameters

```

### Model 2: Transition-Dependent Model-Free RL
This model assumes the participant is **Model-Free** (learning spaceship values from outcomes directly) but modulates their learning based on the **reliability of the transition**. They may learn aggressively from "Common" transitions (which are reliable indicators) and suppress learning from "Rare" transitions (treating them as noise), or vice-versa. This captures interaction between transition structure and model-free updating.

    """

    - alpha_c: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1 after Common transitions.

### Model 3: Model-Free Q-Learning with Decay and Stickiness
This model uses standard **Q-learning (TD(0))** logic (chaining values from Stage 2 to Stage 1) but adds two temporal mechanisms: **Decay** (forgetting old values, useful for drifting probabilities) and **Stickiness** (a tendency to repeat choices regardless of value). This contrasts with the previous best model by using TD(0) instead of direct reward updating, and by adding decay.
