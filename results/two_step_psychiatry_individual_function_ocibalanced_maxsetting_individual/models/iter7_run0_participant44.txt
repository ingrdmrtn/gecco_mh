Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task, designed to capture the specific patterns observed in the participant's data, such as the strong preference for Spaceship 1 and the potential for generalized learning.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Spatial Bias
This model incorporates a static "Side Bias" into the first-stage decision. The participant data shows a persistent preference for Spaceship 1 (U) over Spaceship 0 (A). While standard models explain choices via value learning, a bias parameter accounts for intrinsic or habitual preferences for a specific response option (e.g., "handedness" or a default strategy) that acts independently of the reward history.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid learner with a static Spatial Bias (Side Bias).
    
    Incorporates a bias term to the net Q-value of Action 1 (Spaceship U).
    This captures the participant's observed baseline preference for one spaceship 
    independent of reward history.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr: [0, 1] Learning rate for both stages.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - bias: [0, 1] Bias added to Action 1. 
            (A value > 0 increases probability of choosing Action 1).
    """
    lr, beta, w, bias = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # state x action

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Model-Based Value: Expected value of next states
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Net Value: Weighted sum of MB and MF + Bias
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        # Apply bias to Action 1 (Spaceship U)
        # We scale bias by 2 to allow it to have a strong impact within [0,1] range
        # effectively acting as a value boost.
        q_net[1] += bias * 2.0 

        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += lr * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Learner with Stage 2 Generalization
This model hypothesizes that the participant generalizes outcomes from one alien to the other within the same planet. If a planet is "good," they might assume both aliens are good. The `kappa` parameter controls the extent to which the reward prediction error (RPE) from the chosen alien updates the value of the *unchosen* alien on the same planet. This is a form of counterfactual updating or state-level value learning.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid learner with Stage 2 Generalization (Cross-Alien Learning).
    
    When updating the value of the chosen alien, the model also updates 
    the unchosen alien on the same planet by a fraction (kappa) of the RPE.
    This captures the belief that the 'Planet' is rewarding, not just the specific alien.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight.
    - kappa: [0, 1] Generalization rate. 
             (0 = Independent aliens, 1 = Perfect correlation/Planet-level value).

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Action-Specific Learning Rates
This model proposes that the participant learns about the two spaceships (Stage 1 actions) at different rates. Given the strong bias towards choosing Spaceship 1, the participant may update their beliefs about Spaceship 1 efficiently while failing to learn as much about Spaceship 0 (or vice versa). This asymmetry is distinct from positive/negative learning rates and focuses on the *object* of learning (Action 0 vs Action 1).

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid learner with Action-Specific Learning Rates for Stage 1.
    
    Allows different learning rates for Spaceship A (Action 0) and Spaceship U (Action 1).
    This captures potential attentional biases where the participant learns efficiently 
    about their preferred option but ignores information about the other.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr_s1_0: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1 Action 0 (Spaceship A).
    - lr_s1_1: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1 Action 1 (Spaceship U).
