Here are three new cognitive models based on the participant data and the analysis of previous attempts.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Learner with Transition-Dependent Updating (Filter Model).
    
    This model hypothesizes that the participant filters learning based on transition types.
    It applies different learning rates for 'Common' vs 'Rare' transitions when updating 
    Stage 1 values, effectively allowing the agent to ignore or emphasize misleading 
    Rare transitions (mimicking a Model-Based trait within a Model-Free framework).
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_c: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1 after a Common transition.
    - alpha_r: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1 after a Rare transition.
    - alpha_2: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 (Alien values).
    - decay: [0, 1] Decay rate for unchosen Q-values.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2.
    - stickiness: [0, 5] Bonus for repeating the last Stage 1 choice.
