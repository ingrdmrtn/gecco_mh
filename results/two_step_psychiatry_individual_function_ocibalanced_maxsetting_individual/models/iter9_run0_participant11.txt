Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task, formulated as Python functions.

### Model 1: Model-Free Q-Learning with Outcome-Dependent Exploration
This model tests the hypothesis that the participant's level of exploration (randomness) in the first stage is modulated by the previous trial's outcome. Specifically, a reward may precipitate a "high confidence" state (higher `beta`, exploitation), while a lack of reward may induce a "low confidence" state (lower `beta`, exploration). This is distinct from stickiness, which biases *what* is chosen; this biases *how deterministically* it is chosen.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Q-Learning with Outcome-Dependent Exploration (Beta-Win/Loss).
    
    This model allows the inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation balance) 
    for the first-stage choice to vary depending on the outcome of the previous trial.
    A 'Win' leads to `beta_win` (likely higher, exploit), while a 'Loss' leads to 
    `beta_loss` (likely lower, explore). Stickiness is also included to account for 
    outcome-dependent repetition bias.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for Q-values.
    - beta_win: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 after a reward.
    - beta_loss: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 after no reward.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2.
    - lambda_param: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay parameter.
    - stick_win: [0, 5] Stickiness bonus after a win.
    - stick_loss: [0, 5] Stickiness bonus after a loss.

### Model 2: Model-Free Q-Learning with Outcome-Dependent Eligibility Traces
This model hypothesizes that the credit assignment to the first-stage choice is modulated by the outcome. A reward might reinforce the entire trajectory (high `lambda`), while a lack of reward might break the link between stages (low `lambda`), attributing the failure locally to the second stage.

```python

    Model-Free Q-Learning with Outcome-Dependent Eligibility Traces (Lambda-Win/Loss).
    
    This model posits that the eligibility trace (lambda), which determines how much
    the Stage 2 prediction error affects Stage 1 values, depends on the outcome.
    A 'Win' may trigger a stronger eligibility trace (reinforcing the path), while
    a 'Loss' may trigger a weaker one.

    - lambda_loss: [0, 1] Eligibility trace parameter after no reward.

### Model 3: Model-Free Q-Learning with Dual Habit Mechanisms
This model combines two distinct types of perseveration: a fast, outcome-sensitive "stickiness" (Win-Stay/Lose-Shift) and a slower, outcome-insensitive "Choice Kernel" (habit). This structure allows the model to capture the participant's tendency to maintain long streaks (habit) while still reacting to immediate outcomes (stickiness).

    """

    1. A slowly decaying Choice Kernel (habit) that tracks choice frequency over time.
    2. An immediate Reward-Dependent Stickiness that reacts to the most recent outcome.
