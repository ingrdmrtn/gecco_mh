Here are three cognitive models based on the participant's data and the two-step task structure.

### Model 1: Dynamic Transition Learning with Dual Stickiness
**Rationale:** The participant data shows responses to rare transitions (e.g., Trial 2, 12, 22). While the standard model assumes a fixed transition matrix (0.7/0.3), participants often *learn* these probabilities over time, especially if they experience streaks of rare transitions. This model allows the agent to update their internal model of the spaceship-planet transition probabilities (`trans_lr`). It combines this with **Dual Stickiness** (separate perseveration for spaceship and alien), which was identified as a strong feature in previous iterations.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Dynamic Transition Learning with Dual Stickiness.
    
    The agent learns the transition matrix (Spaceship -> Planet) over time 
    rather than assuming fixed probabilities. This affects the Model-Based 
    value calculation. Also includes separate stickiness for both stages.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0,1] Value learning rate.
    - beta_1: [0,10] Inverse temp for Stage 1 (Spaceship).
    - beta_2: [0,10] Inverse temp for Stage 2 (Alien).
    - w: [0,1] Weighting between MB (1) and MF (0).
    - stick_1: [0,10] Stickiness for Spaceship choice.
    - stick_2: [0,10] Stickiness for Alien choice.
    - trans_lr: [0,1] Learning rate for the transition matrix.

```

### Model 2: Dual Stickiness with Memory Decay
**Rationale:** The participant exhibits long streaks of behavior (e.g., Trials 18-24). Standard Q-learning only updates the chosen option. This model introduces **Memory Decay**, where the values of *unchosen* options (and chosen ones before update) slowly decay towards 0. This implies that if an alien or spaceship isn't visited for a while, the agent "forgets" its value, making them potentially rely more on stickiness or recent rewards. This is combined with the successful Dual Stickiness mechanism.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Dual Stickiness with Q-Value Decay.
    
    Incorporates a forgetting mechanism. On every trial, Q-values decay 
    towards 0 before the chosen option is reinforced. This helps explain 
    behavior where old knowledge becomes less relevant than recent experience.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate for chosen options.
    - beta_1: [0,10] Inv temp Stage 1.
    - beta_2: [0,10] Inv temp Stage 2.
    - w: [0,1] MB/MF weight.
    - stick_1: [0,10] Stickiness Stage 1.
    - stick_2: [0,10] Stickiness Stage 2.

### Model 3: Transition-Dependent Learning with Dual Stickiness
**Rationale:** In the two-step task, "Common" and "Rare" transitions carry different information. A Model-Free agent might treat them identically, while a Model-Based agent distinguishes them. This model hypothesizes that the participant updates their Model-Free values differently depending on whether the transition was Common or Rare. For example, they might discount the prediction error from a Rare transition (`lr_rare`) compared to a Common one (`lr_common`). This is combined with Dual Stickiness to account for the repetitive behavior.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Transition-Dependent Learning Rates with Dual Stickiness.
    
    The agent uses different learning rates for the Stage 1 Model-Free update 
    depending on whether the transition was Common or Rare. This captures 
    heuristics where agents might ignore outcomes from 'unlucky' (rare) transitions.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr_common: [0,1] Learning rate after a Common transition.
    - lr_rare: [0,1] Learning rate after a Rare transition.
    - beta_1: [0,10] Inv temp Stage 1.
    - beta_2: [0,10] Inv temp Stage 2.
    - w: [0,1] MB/MF weight.

    - stick_2: [0,10] Stickiness Stage 2.
