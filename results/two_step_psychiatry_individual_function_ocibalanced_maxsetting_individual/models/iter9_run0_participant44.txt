Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task, designed to capture the specific behavioral patterns observed in the participant data (e.g., side bias, potential strategy shifts, and asymmetric learning).

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with Spatial Bias and Stickiness
This model integrates the **Spatial Bias** (from your best model) with **Choice Stickiness** (Perseverance). The participant shows a clear baseline preference for Spaceship 1 but also exhibits "streaks" of choices (e.g., Trials 133-140). While the bias captures the static preference, the stickiness parameter captures the dynamic tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice regardless of reward, a common phenomenon in reinforcement learning tasks.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid learner with Spatial Bias and Choice Stickiness (Perseverance).
    
    Combines a static bias for Action 1 with a dynamic bonus for repeating 
    the previous Stage 1 choice.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr: [0, 1] Learning rate for both stages.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (softmax sensitivity).
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - bias: [0, 5] Static bias added to Action 1 Q-value.
    - stick: [0, 5] Stickiness bonus added to the previously chosen action's Q-value.

    lr, beta, w, bias, stick = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # state x action
    
    prev_action_1 = -1

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Model-Based Value Calculation
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        # Net Q-value Calculation
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        # Add Spatial Bias (preference for Action 1)

        # Add Stickiness (bonus for repeating previous choice)
        if prev_action_1 != -1:
            q_net[prev_action_1] += stick

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Learner with Asymmetric Learning Rates and Bias
This model hypothesizes that the participant learns differently from positive outcomes (rewards) versus negative outcomes (omissions), a trait often linked to risk sensitivity. It incorporates the **Spatial Bias** to account for the preference for Spaceship 1, but splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`. This allows the model to capture behavior where the participant might be quick to learn from wins but slow to unlearn after losses (or vice versa).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    negative prediction errors (losses/omissions).

    - lr_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    - lr_neg: [0, 1] Learning rate for negative prediction errors.

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with Time-Varying Mixing Weight
This model tests the hypothesis of **strategy adaptation**: that the participant's reliance on Model-Based (planning) vs. Model-Free (habitual) strategies changes over the course of the experiment. The parameter `w` linearly interpolates between `w_start` and `w_end` across the 200 trials. This can explain if the participant "learns to plan" (increasing `w`) or "falls back to habits" / fatigues (decreasing `w`) as the task progresses.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid learner with Time-Varying Mixing Weight (Dynamic Strategy).

    control changes linearly from the start to the end of the task.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w_start: [0, 1] Mixing weight at trial 0.
    - w_end: [0, 1] Mixing weight at the final trial.
