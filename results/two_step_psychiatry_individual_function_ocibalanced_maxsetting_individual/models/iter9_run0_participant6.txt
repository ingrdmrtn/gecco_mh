Here are three new cognitive models, expressed as Python functions, designed to explain the participant's behavior in the two-step decision task.

### Cognitive Model 1
**Hybrid Learner with Separate Stage Learning Rates and Value Decay**
This model extends the successful logic of the previous best model (separate learning rates for each stage and value decay) by adding a Model-Based component (`w`). It tests whether the participant integrates explicit knowledge of the transition structure alongside their robust Model-Free reinforcement learning.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Learner with Separate Stage Learning Rates and Value Decay.
    
    Extends the Model-Free learner with a Model-Based component (w) to test 
    if the participant uses the transition structure alongside the split-plasticity 
    and decay mechanisms.
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_1: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1 MF values.
    - alpha_2: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2 values.
    - decay_rate: [0, 1] Decay rate for unchosen Q-values.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2.
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - stickiness: [0, 5] Bonus for repeating the last Stage 1 choice.

### Cognitive Model 2
**Model-Free Learner with Split Alphas, Decay, and Outcome-Dependent Stickiness**
This model refines the stickiness mechanism. Instead of a single stickiness parameter, it differentiates between the tendency to repeat a choice after a reward (`stick_win`) versus after a non-reward (`stick_loss`). This captures "win-stay, lose-shift" dynamics more explicitly while retaining the effective split-stage learning and decay.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    Refines the stickiness mechanism by distinguishing between 'Win-Stay' (stick_win)
    and 'Lose-Shift' (stick_loss) tendencies, while maintaining the separate learning
    rates and decay that proved effective.
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_1: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 1.
    - alpha_2: [0, 1] Learning rate for Stage 2.
    - decay_rate: [0, 1] Decay rate for unchosen Q-values.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2.
    - stick_win: [0, 5] Stickiness bonus after a reward.
    - stick_loss: [0, 5] Stickiness bonus after no reward.

### Cognitive Model 3
**Hybrid Learner with Dynamic Transition Learning**
This model posits that the participant is not working with a fixed transition matrix (0.7/0.3) but is actively learning the transition probabilities (`alpha_trans`) between spaceships and planets. This accounts for potential reactions to the "rare transitions" observed in the data.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """

    (Spaceship -> Planet) based on experience, rather than assuming it is fixed.
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_val: [0, 1] Learning rate for Q-values (Stage 1 & 2).
    - alpha_trans: [0, 1] Learning rate for transition probabilities.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2.
