Here are three new cognitive models based on the participant data and the analysis of potential learning mechanisms.

### Model 1: Risk-Sensitive Counterfactual Model
This model extends the successful counterfactual approach by introducing **risk-sensitive learning rates** (`alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`). The participant may weigh positive and negative prediction errors differently (e.g., learning more from losses than wins, or vice versa). It combines this with **counterfactual updating** for the unchosen alien and **decay** for unvisited states.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """
    Risk-Sensitive Counterfactual Model.
    
    Distinguishes between positive and negative prediction errors with separate 
    learning rates (alpha_pos, alpha_neg). Also includes counterfactual updating 
    for the unchosen alien and decay for unchosen/unvisited options.
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_pos: Learning rate for positive prediction errors [0, 1]
    - alpha_neg: Learning rate for negative prediction errors [0, 1]
    - beta_1: Inverse temperature for Stage 1 [0, 10]
    - beta_2: Inverse temperature for Stage 2 [0, 10]
    - w: Mixing weight between Model-Based and Model-Free values [0, 1]
    - lam: Eligibility trace parameter [0, 1]
    - alpha_cf: Learning rate for the counterfactual update (unchosen alien) [0, 1]
    - decay: Decay rate for unchosen Stage 1 and unvisited Stage 2 values [0, 1]

### Model 2: Subjective Transition Model
This model hypothesizes that the participant does not use the objective transition probabilities (0.7/0.3) but instead learns or assumes a **subjective transition probability** (`subj_prob`). This internal model biases the Model-Based value calculation. This accounts for potential overestimation of rare transitions or underestimation of common ones.

### Model 3: Transition-Dependent Stickiness Model
This model proposes that the tendency to repeat a choice (stickiness) depends on whether the previous transition was **Common** or **Rare**. A rare transition might disrupt the habit or cause the participant to switch strategies, while a common transition might reinforce the repetition. This is captured by `stick_common` and `stick_rare`.
