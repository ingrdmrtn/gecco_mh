Here are three new cognitive models based on the participant data and the successful mechanisms identified (decay, eligibility traces, and model-based learning).

### Cognitive Model 1
This model introduces **separate learning rates** for Stage 1 (Spaceships) and Stage 2 (Aliens). The participant data suggests that learning the stable transition structure (Stage 1) might occur at a different rate than tracking the slowly drifting alien reward probabilities (Stage 2). It retains the successful decay mechanism for unchosen aliens and eligibility traces.

```python

    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with Dual Learning Rates, Decay, and Eligibility Trace.
    
    Distinguishes between the learning rate for the stable Stage 1 (Spaceships)
    and the drifting Stage 2 (Aliens).
    
    Parameters:
    lr_s1: [0,1] - Learning rate for Stage 1 updates.
    lr_s2: [0,1] - Learning rate for Stage 2 updates.
    decay_rate: [0,1] - Decay rate for unchosen Stage 2 options.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0,1] - Mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB).
    lambda_elig: [0,1] - Eligibility trace decay.
    stickiness: [0,5] - Choice perseverance bonus for Stage 1.

### Cognitive Model 2
This model incorporates **Response Stickiness** (Motor Perseveration) alongside standard choice stickiness. It hypothesizes that the participant has a bias to repeat the same motor action (e.g., pressing the left button, index 0) from Stage 1 to Stage 2. This is combined with the decay and eligibility mechanisms.

    choose the same action index (0 or 1) in Stage 2 as they did in Stage 1 
    (Motor Perseveration).

### Cognitive Model 3
This model implements **Outcome-Dependent Stickiness** (Win-Stay, Lose-Shift) combined with Eligibility Traces. The participant data suggests a strong tendency to repeat choices after rewards, which might differ from the tendency to repeat after losses. This model applies different stickiness bonuses based on the previous trial's outcome.
