    Model-Free Q-learning with Choice Stickiness modulated by OCI.
    
    Hypothesis: OCI is associated with behavioral rigidity or perseveration.
    The OCI score increases the 'stickiness' parameter, making the agent more 
    likely to repeat the previous Stage 1 action regardless of reward.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - stickiness_base: [-2, 2] Baseline tendency to repeat choices.
    - oci_perseveration: [0, 5] How strongly OCI increases stickiness.
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0, 1]
    beta: [0, 10]
    stickiness_base: [0, 2]
    oci_perseveration: [0, 5]
