    Model-Based Learner with OCI-modulated Perseveration.
    
    This model assumes the participant is primarily Model-Based but suffers from
    choice "stickiness" (perseveration) which is scaled by their OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Learning rate for Stage 2 values.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature for both stages.
    persev_base: [0,5] Base tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice.
