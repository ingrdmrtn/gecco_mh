    Model 2: OCI-driven Choice Perseveration (Stickiness).
    
    Hypothesis: OCI symptoms relate to repetitive behaviors. This model adds a 
    perseveration bonus to the previously chosen action in Stage 1. The magnitude
    of this bonus is determined by the OCI score.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate of updating Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control.
    - stickiness_factor: [0, 5] Base magnitude of perseveration, scaled by OCI.
