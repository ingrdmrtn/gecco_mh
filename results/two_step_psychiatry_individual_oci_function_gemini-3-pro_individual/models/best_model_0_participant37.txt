    Model 3: OCI-Driven Win-Stay Bias.
    
    Hypothesis: OCI is linked to a reliance on simple heuristic strategies over 
    complex probabilistic modeling. This model implements an OCI-modulated 
    "Win-Stay" bias. If the previous trial was rewarded, the value of the 
    previously chosen spaceship is artificially boosted in the decision process, 
    independent of the actual Q-values.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] Model-based weight.
    oci_wsls_amp: [0, 5] Amplitude of the Win-Stay bias scaled by OCI.
