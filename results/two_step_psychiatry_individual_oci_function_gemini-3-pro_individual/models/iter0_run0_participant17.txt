Here are three cognitive models designed to explain the participant's behavior in the two-step task, incorporating their low OCI-R score (0.175) to modulate learning and decision-making parameters.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Hybrid
This model assumes that the balance between Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) control is influenced by the OCI score. Specifically, it posits that even low levels of OCI might relate to a slight rigidity or reliance on habits (Model-Free), or conversely, that low OCI represents a healthy, flexible balance heavily weighted towards goal-directed (Model-Based) behavior. Here, we model the mixing weight `w` as a function of OCI.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid reinforcement learning model where the balance between Model-Based (MB) 
    and Model-Free (MF) control is modulated by the OCI score.
    
    The mixing weight 'w' determines the contribution of MB vs MF values.
    w = 1 implies pure MB, w = 0 implies pure MF.
    We model w as a logistic function of OCI to keep it between 0 and 1.

    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]
    
    # Transform OCI into a mixing weight 'w' bounded [0,1].
    # We hypothesize that higher OCI might reduce model-based control (lower w).
    # Since this participant has low OCI, they should have a higher w.
    # Using a sigmoid transform: w = 1 / (1 + exp(-(w_base - 5 * oci)))
    # If OCI is low, the term (w_base - small) is likely positive, pushing w -> 1.
    w = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-(w_base - 5.0 * oci_score)))

### Model 2: OCI-Linked Stickiness (Perseveration)
This model focuses on "stickiness" or choice perseveration (repeating the previous choice regardless of reward). OCI is often linked to repetitive behaviors. Even though this participant has a low score, the model tests if the *degree* of choice repetition is scaled by their OCI score. A low OCI suggests low pathological repetition, but perhaps a baseline healthy level of consistency.

```python

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate Asymmetry
This model hypothesizes that OCI scores affect how participants process positive versus negative prediction errors. While high OCI might be associated with over-sensitivity to punishment (negative errors), a low OCI score (like 0.175) might indicate a balanced or reward-focused learning style. This model splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`, deriving the ratio between them from the OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Reinforcement learning model with asymmetric learning rates for positive 
    and negative prediction errors. The bias towards positive or negative 
    learning is modulated by the OCI score.
    
    Bounds:

    # We assume low OCI might correlate with "healthier" or more reward-sensitive learning,
    # whereas high OCI might focus on error avoidance.
    # This formula creates a ratio roughly centered around 0.5 but shifted by OCI.
    # Lower OCI -> higher positive bias.
