Here are three cognitive models proposing different mechanisms for how a participant with low OCI-R scores might learn in this two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with OCI-Modulated Model-Based Control
This model assumes that the balance between Model-Free (habitual) and Model-Based (goal-directed) control is influenced by the OCI score. Since this participant has a low OCI score (0.1125), this model hypothesizes they might rely more heavily on model-based planning (calculating expected values based on transition probabilities) rather than pure habit, as high compulsivity is often associated with rigid, habitual behavior. The parameter `w` (mixing weight) is modulated by OCI.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free learner where the mixing weight 'w' is 
    modulated by the OCI score.
    
    Hypothesis: Lower OCI scores correlate with higher model-based control (w -> 1).
    Higher OCI scores correlate with more habitual/model-free control (w -> 0).
    
    Parameters:
    lr: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w_base: [0, 1] Baseline mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB).
    oci_sens: [0, 5] Sensitivity of mixing weight to OCI score.

    # Calculate effective w based on OCI. 
    # We assume low OCI -> high w (Model-Based). 
    # As OCI increases, w decreases (more Model-Free).
    # Using a sigmoid-like constraint or simple linear clip to keep w in [0,1].

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model posits that OCI scores relate to "stickiness" or choice perseveration (repeating the previous choice regardless of reward). Even though the participant has a low score, the model tests the hypothesis that the degree of repetition bias is a function of their OCI trait. A low OCI score might imply very low or even negative stickiness (switching), whereas high OCI implies high stickiness.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_val = oci[0]
    
    # Calculate effective perseveration bonus
    # High OCI -> Higher tendency to stick to previous choice
    k_stick = pers_base + (oci_factor * oci_val)
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Second-Stage Learning Rate
This model suggests that OCI symptoms affect how intensely participants learn from the immediate outcomes at the second stage (the aliens). Obsessive-compulsive traits might be linked to hyper-sensitivity to feedback or "over-updating" based on prediction errors. This model allows the learning rate itself to be a function of the OCI score.

```python

    """

    might imply volatile updating.

    lr_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate.
