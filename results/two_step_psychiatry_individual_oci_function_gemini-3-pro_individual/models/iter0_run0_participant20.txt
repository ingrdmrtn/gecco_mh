Here are three cognitive models designed to explain the participant's behavior in the two-step task, incorporating their OCI score into the decision-making or learning process.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with OCI-Modulated Mixing Weight
This model assumes that the participant uses a hybrid of Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) reinforcement learning strategies. The key hypothesis here is that the balance between these strategies (`w`) is influenced by the participant's OCI score. Even though this participant has a low score, the functional form allows the model to scale this influence across a population.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free learner where the mixing weight 'w' is 
    modulated by the OCI score.
    
    Model Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - w_base: [0, 1] Base weight for Model-Based control (0 = pure MF, 1 = pure MB).
    - w_oci_slope: [0, 1] Sensitivity of the mixing weight to the OCI score.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_base, w_oci_slope = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    current_oci = oci[0]
    
    # Calculate mixing weight w, bounded between 0 and 1.
    # We hypothesize OCI might push towards habit (MF) or planning (MB).
    # Here, we model it as an additive effect on the base weight.
    w = w_base + (w_oci_slope * current_oci)
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)

    # Transition matrix (fixed for this task structure)
    # 0 -> 0 (common 70%), 0 -> 1 (rare 30%)
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) # Model-free values for stage 1 (Spaceships)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Model-free values for stage 2 (Aliens)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # Hybrid Value: w * MB + (1-w) * MF
        q_net = (w * q_stage1_mb) + ((1 - w) * q_stage1_mf)
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

```

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model posits that OCI scores relate to "stickiness" or perseveration—the tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward history. A low OCI score (like this participant's) might imply very low stickiness, or standard flexibility, whereas high scores might imply rigid repetition.

```python

    current_oci = oci[0]
    
    # Calculate effective stickiness parameter
    # Higher OCI -> Higher tendency to repeat choices (if parameter is positive)
    perseveration_weight = stickiness_base + (stickiness_oci_mod * current_oci)

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate Asymmetry
This model investigates if OCI affects how participants learn from positive versus negative outcomes. Specifically, it tests if the OCI score modulates the learning rate for *negative* prediction errors (disappointments), potentially reflecting a sensitivity to failure or checking behavior often associated with OC traits.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):

    prediction errors, where the negative learning rate is modulated by OCI.

    - alpha_neg_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate for negative prediction errors.
