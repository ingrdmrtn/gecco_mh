Here are three cognitive models designed to explain the participant's behavior, incorporating their low OCI-R score (0.2375) into the decision-making mechanics.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weight
This model assumes that the balance between Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) control is influenced by the participant's obsessive-compulsive traits. Given the low OCI score (indicating low compulsivity), this participant might rely more heavily on goal-directed (Model-Based) strategies compared to someone with high compulsivity (who might be more habitual). The parameter `w` (mixing weight) is modulated by the OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free learner where the weighting (w) is modulated by OCI.
    
    The mixing weight 'w' determines the balance between Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) control.
    w = 1 implies pure MB, w = 0 implies pure MF.
    Here, the effective w is influenced by the base_w parameter and the inverse of the OCI score,
    reflecting the hypothesis that lower compulsivity (low OCI) allows for more flexible, model-based planning.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for Q-value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - base_w: [0, 1] Base weight for model-based control.
    - oci_sensitivity: [0, 1] How strongly OCI reduces model-based control.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, base_w, oci_sensitivity = model_parameters

    # Calculate effective mixing weight w. 
    # Logic: Higher OCI (more compulsivity) reduces MB control.
    # We clip to ensure it stays within [0, 1].

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model posits that OCI scores relate to "stickiness" or choice perseveration—the tendency to repeat the previous action regardless of reward. Even though this participant has a low OCI, the model allows the data to determine if their "low" score translates to low stickiness (flexible switching) or if there is a baseline level of habit.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free learner with Choice Perseveration (Stickiness) modulated by OCI.
    
    This model adds a 'stickiness' bonus to the previously chosen action.
    The magnitude of this stickiness is determined by a base parameter plus an OCI-dependent factor.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - stick_base: [0, 5] Base bonus for repeating the last choice.
    - oci_stick_mod: [0, 5] Additional stickiness scaling with OCI score.

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1 = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    # Track last choice (initialize with -1 or None, handle in loop)
    last_action_1 = -1

    # Calculate effective stickiness

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Reward Sensitivity (Learning Rate)
This model tests the hypothesis that OCI scores affect how aggressively a participant learns from prediction errors. A low OCI score (low anxiety/compulsivity) might correlate with a more stable, optimal learning rate, whereas high scores might lead to over-correction (high alpha) or under-reaction. Here, the learning rate is a function of the base rate and the OCI score.

```python

    """

    but their sensitivity to reward prediction errors (learning rate) is influenced by their OCI score.

    - base_lr: [0, 1] Base learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
