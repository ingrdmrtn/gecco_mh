Here are three cognitive models designed to capture decision-making in the two-step task, incorporating the OCI-R score to modulate specific mechanisms like stickiness, model-based control, and learning rates.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Hybrid
This model hypothesizes that individuals with higher OCI scores rely more heavily on habit-based (Model-Free) learning rather than goal-directed (Model-Based) planning. The `w` parameter (mixing weight) is modulated by the OCI score. A higher OCI score reduces `w`, pushing the agent towards Model-Free control.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free reinforcement learning model where the balance 
    between systems (w) is modulated by the OCI score.
    
    Hypothesis: Higher OCI scores lead to reduced Model-Based control (lower w),
    reflecting a reliance on habitual behaviors.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - w_base: [0, 1] Baseline weight for Model-Based control (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - oci_sens: [0, 5] Sensitivity of the weighting parameter to the OCI score.
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0, 1]
    beta: [0, 10]
    w_base: [0, 1]
    oci_sens: [0, 5]

    # Higher OCI reduces w (less model-based).
    w = w_base - (oci_sens * current_oci)
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Choice Stickiness (Perseveration)
This model posits that OCI symptoms manifest as "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous action regardless of the reward outcome. The OCI score directly scales the `stickiness` parameter, making high-OCI individuals more likely to repeat their Stage 1 choice.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Q-learning with Choice Stickiness modulated by OCI.
    
    Hypothesis: OCI is associated with behavioral rigidity or perseveration.
    The OCI score increases the 'stickiness' parameter, making the agent more 
    likely to repeat the previous Stage 1 action regardless of reward.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - stickiness_base: [-2, 2] Baseline tendency to repeat choices.

    n_trials = len(action_1)
    current_oci = oci[0]

    # Calculate effective stickiness
    # Higher OCI -> Higher stickiness (stronger urge to repeat previous choice)
    stickiness_param = stickiness_base + (oci_perseveration * current_oci)

```

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Punishment Sensitivity
This model suggests that OCI relates to anxiety and an increased sensitivity to negative outcomes (lack of reward). Here, the learning rate is split into positive (`lr_pos`) and negative (`lr_neg`) components. The OCI score amplifies `lr_neg`, meaning the agent updates its values more drastically after a loss (0 coins) than a win.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Dual Learning Rate Model (Positive/Negative) where OCI modulates negative learning rate.
    
    Hypothesis: OCI correlates with error-sensitivity or fear of failure.
    Higher OCI scores amplify the learning rate for negative prediction errors 
    (when reward is 0), causing faster avoidance learning.

    Parameters:
    - lr_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors (Reward > Expectation).
    - lr_neg_base: [0, 1] Baseline learning rate for negative prediction errors.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - oci_anxiety: [0, 5] Multiplier for OCI effect on negative learning rate.
