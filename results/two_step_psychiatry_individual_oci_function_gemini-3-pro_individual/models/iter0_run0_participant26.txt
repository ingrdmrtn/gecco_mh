Here are three cognitive models that incorporate the OCI-R score into the decision-making process for the two-step task.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Balance
This model hypothesizes that the balance between Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) control is influenced by the OCI score. Specifically, it tests whether higher OCI scores shift reliance towards habitual (Model-Free) control or planning (Model-Based) control. The parameter `w` (mixing weight) is dynamically adjusted by the OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: OCI-Modulated MB/MF Balance.
    
    This model assumes the OCI score modulates the mixing weight 'w' between 
    Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) values.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - w_base: [0, 1] Baseline mixing weight (0=pure MF, 1=pure MB).
    - oci_sens: [0, 1] Sensitivity of the mixing weight to the OCI score.

    # Modulate mixing weight w based on OCI
    # We use a sigmoid-like transformation or simple linear scaling clipped to [0,1]
    # Hypothesis: Does OCI increase or decrease MB control?
    # Here: w = w_base + (oci_sens * (current_oci - 0.5))
    # Note: OCI is roughly 0 to 1 based on provided buckets, though raw scores vary.
    # Given the low score (0.1625), this term will likely reduce w if oci_sens is positive.
    w = w_base + oci_sens * (current_oci - 0.3) # Centering around the low/med cutoff
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model hypothesizes that OCI symptoms manifest as "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward. A participant with OCI traits might feel a compulsion to repeat an action. The `stickiness` parameter is scaled by the OCI score.

    stickiness bonus to the previously chosen option, the magnitude of which 
    depends on the OCI score.

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate Asymmetry
This model suggests that OCI affects how participants learn from positive versus negative outcomes. Specifically, it tests if higher OCI scores lead to hyper-sensitivity to punishment (or lack of reward) or reward. We implement separate learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors, where the balance is shifted by OCI.

    (getting more than expected) vs negative prediction errors (getting less).
    It uses a simple Model-Free temporal difference learning scheme for both stages.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
