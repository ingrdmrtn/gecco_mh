Here are three cognitive models designed to explain the participant's behavior in the two-step task, incorporating their OCI-R score to modulate learning and decision-making parameters.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Hybrid
This model assumes that individuals with different OCI scores rely differently on Model-Based (planning) vs. Model-Free (habitual) strategies. Given the participant's low OCI score (low compulsivity), this model posits that higher OCI scores might be associated with a deficit in Model-Based control or a rigidity in Model-Free updating. Here, we model the "mixing weight" ($w$) between the two systems as a function of the OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with OCI-modulated mixing weight.
    
    This model combines Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) values for the first-stage choice.
    The relative influence of the MB system (w) is modulated by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate (alpha): Rate of updating Q-values [0, 1]
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice [0, 10]
    - w_base: Baseline mixing weight for MB system (0=pure MF, 1=pure MB) [0, 1]
    - w_oci_slope: Sensitivity of mixing weight to OCI score [-1, 1]

### Model 2: OCI-Linked Stickiness (Perseveration)
This model focuses on the "stickiness" or perseveration parameter often found in two-step models. Compulsive behaviors are characterized by repetition. This model hypothesizes that the OCI score directly influences the tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice, regardless of the reward outcome (habitual repetition).

    chosen action. The magnitude of this stickiness is scaled by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1]
    - beta: [0, 10]
    - stickiness_base: Base tendency to repeat previous choice [-5, 5]
    - stickiness_oci_mod: How much OCI increases stickiness [0, 5]

    learning_rate, beta, stickiness_base, stickiness_oci_mod = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]
    
    # Calculate effective stickiness
    # Higher OCI -> Higher tendency to repeat regardless of value
    eff_stickiness = stickiness_base + (stickiness_oci_mod * oci_score)

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Learning Rates (Rigidity)
This model investigates if OCI scores relate to cognitive flexibility via learning rates. A common hypothesis in compulsivity is that behavior is rigid and slow to update in the face of changing contingencies. This model allows the learning rate ($\alpha$) to decay as OCI increases.

    """

    speed at which they update their estimates of reward probabilities (Stage 2 values)
    is dependent on their OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_base: Base learning rate [0, 1]
    - alpha_oci_damp: Reduction in learning rate per unit of OCI [0, 1]
