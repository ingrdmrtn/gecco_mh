Here are three cognitive models proposing different mechanisms for how Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI) scores might influence reinforcement learning in this two-step task.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Balance
This model hypothesizes that individuals with higher OCI scores rely more on habitual (model-free) control at the expense of goal-directed (model-based) planning. This aligns with theories suggesting compulsivity is linked to overactive habit formation. The mixing parameter `w` is modulated by the OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: OCI-modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Balance.
    
    This model assumes that the balance between Model-Based (planning) and 
    Model-Free (habitual) systems is influenced by the participant's OCI score.
    Higher OCI scores reduce the weight (w) of the Model-Based system, leading to 
    more habitual behavior.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w_base: [0, 1] Baseline mixing weight (1 = pure MB, 0 = pure MF).
    oci_sensitivity: [0, 2] How strongly OCI reduces the model-based weight.
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0,1]

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Perseveration
This model posits that OCI symptoms manifest as "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward. Here, the OCI score directly scales a perseveration parameter added to the Q-values, making high-OCI participants more likely to repeat their Stage 1 choice.

### Model 3: OCI-Enhanced Learning Rate (Hyper-learning)
This model suggests that OCI is associated with hyper-sensitivity to prediction errors. Individuals with higher OCI scores might over-update their value estimates in response to outcomes. The learning rate `alpha` is boosted by the OCI score, leading to more volatile value estimations.
