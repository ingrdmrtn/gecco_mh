Here are three cognitive models designed to explain the participant's behavior in the two-step task, incorporating their low OCI score (0.1) as a modulating factor.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weight
This model assumes that individuals with different OCI scores rely differently on Model-Based (planning) versus Model-Free (habitual) strategies. Given the low OCI score (0.1), this participant is hypothesized to have a balanced or slightly flexible control system, but the parameter `w` (mixing weight) is directly scaled by the OCI score to test if lower compulsion relates to higher model-based control (or vice versa).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid RL model where the balance between Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) 
    control is modulated by the OCI score.
    
    The mixing weight 'w' determines the contribution of MB vs MF values.
    Here, w is influenced by a baseline parameter plus an OCI interaction.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - w_base: [0, 1] Baseline weight for Model-Based control (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB).
    - oci_sensitivity: [0, 5] How strongly OCI affects the weighting w.

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) # MF values for stage 1 (Spaceships)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # MF values for stage 2 (Aliens)

    # Calculate the effective mixing weight w
    # We use a sigmoid-like transformation or simple clipping to keep w in [0,1]
    # Hypothesis: Higher OCI might reduce MB planning (or increase rigid MF habits).
    # Effective w = w_base - (oci * sensitivity). 
    raw_w = w_base - (current_oci * oci_sensitivity)
    w = np.clip(raw_w, 0.0, 1.0)

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Perseveration (Stickiness)
High OCI is often associated with repetitive behaviors or "stickiness." Even though this participant has a low score (0.1), this model explicitly tests that hypothesis by including a choice autocorrelation (perseveration) parameter that scales with OCI. A low OCI should result in low perseveration (flexible switching), while a high OCI would drive high perseveration.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    The magnitude of this bonus is determined by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1]
    - beta: [0, 10]
    - stickiness_base: [0, 5] Base tendency to repeat actions.

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate Asymmetry
This model investigates if OCI scores relate to how participants process positive versus negative prediction errors. A low OCI participant might learn equally from success and failure, whereas high OCI might be hyper-sensitive to errors (negative feedback). This model splits the learning rate into positive (`alpha_pos`) and negative (`alpha_neg`) components, where the split is modulated by OCI.

```python
