Here are three new cognitive models based on the provided requirements.

### Cognitive Model 1: Hybrid MB/MF with OCI-modulated Mixing Weight
This model tests the hypothesis that Obsessive-Compulsive symptoms shift the balance between Goal-Directed (Model-Based) and Habitual (Model-Free) control. It proposes that the mixing weight `w` (where 1 is fully Model-Based and 0 is fully Model-Free) is a function of the participant's OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free RL with OCI-modulated Mixing Weight.
    
    Hypothesis: High OCI scores correlate with a reliance on Model-Free (habitual) 
    control over Model-Based (goal-directed) control. The mixing weight 'w' 
    is modulated by OCI.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Value updating rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (choice consistency).
    - w_base: [0, 1] Baseline mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - w_oci_mod: [-1, 1] Modulation of mixing weight by OCI score.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_base, w_oci_mod = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_val = oci[0]
    
    # Calculate effective mixing weight bounded between 0 and 1
    w = w_base + (oci_val * w_oci_mod)
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)

### Cognitive Model 2: Hybrid Model with OCI-modulated Learning Rate
This model tests the hypothesis that OCI scores relate to the general speed of value updating (plasticity). High OCI might indicate rapid over-learning (hyper-plasticity) or rigidity (low learning). Here, the OCI score modulates the learning rate used for both stages.

```python

    """
    Hybrid Model with OCI-modulated Learning Rate.

    rate is modulated by OCI, affecting how quickly the participant updates 
    values from prediction errors.

    Parameters:
    - lr_base: [0, 1] Baseline learning rate.
    - lr_oci_mod: [-1, 1] Modulation of learning rate by OCI.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Fixed mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB).

### Cognitive Model 3: Hybrid Model with OCI-modulated Inverse Temperature (Beta)
This model tests the hypothesis that OCI scores relate to decision rigidity versus exploration. A higher OCI might lead to more deterministic choices (higher beta) due to anxiety or a need for control, while a lower OCI might reflect more stochastic behavior.

    Parameters:

    - beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature.
