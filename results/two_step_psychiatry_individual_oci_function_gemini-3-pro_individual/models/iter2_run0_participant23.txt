Here are three new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms by which OCI scores might influence decision-making in the two-step task, specifically focusing on mixing model-based/model-free control, eligibility traces, and second-stage learning rates.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with OCI-modulated Weighting ($w$)
This model is a classic hybrid Reinforcement Learning model that combines Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) values. The key hypothesis here is that OCI symptoms correlate with a rigidity or reliance on habit (MF) over goal-directed planning (MB). Specifically, we test if higher OCI scores reduce the weighting parameter $w$ (making the agent more Model-Free).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free learner where the mixing weight 'w' is modulated by OCI.
    Hypothesis: Higher OCI leads to reduced Model-Based control (lower w).
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - w_intercept: [0, 1] Base weighting for Model-Based values (at OCI=0).
    - w_slope: [-1, 1] How OCI affects w. (Expected negative, but allowed to vary).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_intercept, w_slope = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    current_oci = oci[0]

    # Calculate mixing weight w based on OCI
    # w represents the proportion of Model-Based control
    w = w_intercept + (w_slope * current_oci)
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)

    # Fixed transition matrix (70% common, 30% rare) as per task description
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values
    q_mf_stage1 = np.zeros(2)      # Model-Free Stage 1 values
    q_mb_stage1 = np.zeros(2)      # Model-Based Stage 1 values
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2))    # Stage 2 values (Planets x Aliens) - shared by MB and MF

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        a1 = int(action_1[trial])
        s_idx = int(state[trial]) # 0 for Planet X, 1 for Planet Y
        a2 = int(action_2[trial])
        r = reward[trial]

        delta_stage2 = r - q_stage2[s_idx, a2]
        q_stage2[s_idx, a2] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

        # This uses the value of the chosen second stage option as the target

        q_mf_stage1[a1] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Eligibility Trace ($\lambda$) Modulated by OCI
This model focuses purely on Model-Free mechanisms but introduces an eligibility trace parameter $\lambda$. $\lambda$ determines how much credit the first-stage choice gets for the second-stage reward. If $\lambda=1$, the first stage is updated directly by the final reward (Monte Carlo). If $\lambda=0$, it is only updated by the transition to the second stage (TD(0)). We test if OCI modulates this temporal credit assignment—perhaps high OCI individuals struggle to link distal outcomes to initial choices (low $\lambda$) or over-link them (high $\lambda$).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - lambda_base: [0, 1] Base eligibility trace parameter.

    learning_rate, beta, lambda_base, lambda_slope = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    current_oci = oci[0]

    eligibility_lambda = lambda_base + (lambda_slope * current_oci)
    eligibility_lambda = np.clip(eligibility_lambda, 0.0, 1.0)

### Model 3: Separate Second-Stage Learning Rate for OCI
This model investigates whether the OCI score specifically impacts learning at the second stage (the direct interaction with the aliens). It posits that obsessive-compulsive traits might manifest as "over-learning" or hypersensitivity to the immediate outcome of the probabilistic reward, distinct from the structural learning of the spaceship transition. We use two learning rates: a fixed global one for stage 1, and a modifiable one for stage 2 dependent on OCI.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    while the first stage learning rate is fixed.

    Parameters:
    - lr_stage1: [0, 1] Fixed learning rate for Stage 1.
    - lr_stage2_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate for Stage 2.
