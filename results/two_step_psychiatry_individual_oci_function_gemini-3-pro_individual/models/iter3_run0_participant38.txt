Here are the three proposed cognitive models.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with OCI-Modulated Eligibility Traces
This model hypothesizes that OCI symptoms affect "credit assignment"—specifically, how much the outcome at the second stage (the coin) reinforces the choice made at the first stage (the spaceship). A high eligibility trace ($\lambda$) implies a strong link between the final reward and the initial choice. This model tests if OCI scores correlate with a tendency to over-associate (or under-associate) distal rewards with proximal choices.

```python

    """
    Model 1: Hybrid MB/MF with OCI-modulated Eligibility Trace.
    
    This model assumes a Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free architecture.
    The eligibility trace parameter (lambda), which controls how much the Stage 2 
    reward updates the Stage 1 value, is modulated by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Update rate for Q-values [0, 1]
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice [0, 10]
    - w: Mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB) [0, 1]

### Model 2: Hybrid Learner with OCI-Modulated Perseveration
While the "best model so far" used perseveration in a purely Model-Free context, this model integrates perseveration into the full Hybrid (Model-Based + Model-Free) framework. It posits that OCI symptoms drive a "stickiness" or repetition compulsion that overrides both goal-directed (MB) and habit-based (MF) value calculations.

    perseveration bonus to the previously chosen action in Stage 1.
    The magnitude of this 'stickiness' is determined by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Update rate for Q-values [0, 1]
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice [0, 10]

### Model 3: Hybrid Learner with OCI-Modulated Stage 2 Learning Rate
This model proposes that OCI symptoms specifically impact the learning rate for the terminal reward stage (Stage 2), distinct from the general learning rate or the Stage 1 transition learning. It separates the learning process into two streams: one for the first decision (controlled by a fixed rate) and one for the alien/coin outcome (controlled by an OCI-modulated rate). This tests if OCI is associated with hyper-sensitivity or hypo-sensitivity to immediate reward feedback.
