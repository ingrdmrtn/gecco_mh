Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for how OCI might influence decision-making in the two-step task. These models move beyond simple modulation of beta or learning rates and investigate the balance between model-based/model-free control and the specific impact of reward valence.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with OCI-modulated Model-Based Weight (`w`)
This model hypothesizes that OCI symptoms specifically affect the balance between goal-directed (Model-Based) and habitual (Model-Free) control. High OCI might lead to an over-reliance on habitual systems (lower `w`) or, conversely, rigid goal-directed control. This model allows the mixing parameter `w` to vary linearly with OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free learner where the mixing weight 'w' is modulated by OCI.
    
    This tests the hypothesis that OCI symptoms shift the balance between 
    goal-directed (MB) and habitual (MF) control systems.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w_base: [0, 1] Baseline weight for Model-Based control (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB).
    w_oci_mod: [-1, 1] Modulation of w by OCI score.

### Model 2: Asymmetric Learning Rates Modulated by OCI
This model investigates if OCI relates to a bias in learning from positive versus negative feedback. It proposes that the learning rate for negative prediction errors (`alpha_neg`) is distinct from positive ones (`alpha_pos`), and that OCI specifically exacerbates or diminishes the sensitivity to negative outcomes (punishment/loss).

```python

    Parameters:
    alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    alpha_neg_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate for negative prediction errors.

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Stickiness (Choice Perseveration)
This model posits that OCI relates to behavioral rigidity or "stickiness"—the tendency to repeat the previous action regardless of reward outcome. It modifies a standard Hybrid learner by adding a stickiness parameter that is a function of the OCI score. This separates the concept of "learning" (value update) from "repetition" (motor/choice history).
