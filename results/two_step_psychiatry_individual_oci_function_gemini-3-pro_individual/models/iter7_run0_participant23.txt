Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task, incorporating OCI scores into specific mechanisms of learning and decision-making.

### Model 1: Structural Doubt (Transition Confidence)
This model hypothesizes that OCI is associated with reduced confidence in the learned structure of the environment. While the true transition probabilities are 0.7/0.3, high OCI might lead to a "flatter" subjective transition matrix (closer to 0.5/0.5), representing doubt or uncertainty. This affects the Model-Based value calculation.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid model where OCI modulates the confidence in the transition structure.
    High OCI may lead to a 'flatter' perceived transition matrix (structural doubt),
    diluting the Model-Based value calculation.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for MF values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (softmax sensitivity).
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - conf_base: [0, 1] Base confidence in the 0.7/0.3 transition structure.
    - conf_oci_slope: [-1, 1] Modulation of confidence by OCI. 
    """

    current_oci = oci[0]

    # Calculate subjective confidence in the structure
    # Confidence 1.0 = belief in [0.7, 0.3]; Confidence 0.0 = belief in [0.5, 0.5]
    confidence = conf_base + (current_oci * conf_oci_slope)
    confidence = np.clip(confidence, 0.0, 1.0)

    # True transition matrix vs Flat (uncertain) matrix
    T_true = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    T_flat = np.array([[0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5]])

    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Win-Stay Stickiness
This model investigates if OCI is linked to **compulsive repetition of success**. Unlike general stickiness (repeating any choice) or loss-chasing, this mechanism adds a "stickiness bonus" to the previous action *only if it was rewarded*. OCI modulates the magnitude of this bonus.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):

### Model 3: Stage-Specific Precision
This model separates decision noise (beta) for Stage 1 (Spaceship choice) and Stage 2 (Alien choice). It hypothesizes that OCI specifically affects precision at the **outcome stage**. For example, high OCI might correlate with higher anxiety and dithering (lower beta) when selecting the alien, regardless of how precisely they navigated the spaceship.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):

    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 (Spaceship).
