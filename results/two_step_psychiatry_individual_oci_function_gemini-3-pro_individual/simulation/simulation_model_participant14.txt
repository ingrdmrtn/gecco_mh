    Simulates choices and rewards using Model 2: Perseveration Model.
    
    Hypothesis: High OCI relates to behavioral rigidity. The OCI score acts as a 
    gain on a 'stickiness' parameter, increasing the probability of repeating the 
    previous Stage 1 choice regardless of the outcome.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, stickiness_base]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float, list, or None): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
