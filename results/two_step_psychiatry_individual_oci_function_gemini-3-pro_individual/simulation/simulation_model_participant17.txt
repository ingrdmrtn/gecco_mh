    Simulates choices and rewards using Model-Free reinforcement learning with choice stickiness (perseveration),
    where the stickiness parameter is scaled by the OCI score.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, stickiness_factor]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities for the second stage.
        oci (float): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score for the participant.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
