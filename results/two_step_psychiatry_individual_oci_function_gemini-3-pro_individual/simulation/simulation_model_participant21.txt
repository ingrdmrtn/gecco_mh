Here is the simulation code corresponding to the provided model fitting function.

```python
import numpy as np

    """
    Simulates choices and rewards using a Model-Free RL model with OCI-modulated choice perseveration.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, stickiness_base, oci_sticky_factor]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float or None): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score for the participant. 
                             If None, defaults to 0 (no OCI modulation).

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
