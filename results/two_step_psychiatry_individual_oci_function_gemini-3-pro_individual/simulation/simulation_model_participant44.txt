    Simulates choices and rewards using the Model-Free RL model with OCI-modulated 
    choice perseveration (stickiness).

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, stickiness_base, oci_stick_mod]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float or None): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score for the participant.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
