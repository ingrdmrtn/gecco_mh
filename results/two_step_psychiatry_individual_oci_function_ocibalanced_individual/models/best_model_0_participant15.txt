    Reinforcement Learning with OCI-modulated Choice Stickiness (Perseveration).
    
    This model adds a 'stickiness' bonus to the previously chosen action at Stage 1.
    The magnitude of this bonus is scaled by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    stickiness_base: [0, 5] Base tendency to repeat the last choice.
