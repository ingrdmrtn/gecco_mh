    Model 2: OCI-Modulated Rewarded Stickiness (Compulsive Win-Stay).
    
    This model adds a "stickiness" bonus to the choice logits at Stage 1, 
    but ONLY if the previous trial was rewarded. The magnitude of this 
    conditional stickiness is modulated by OCI.
    
    Hypothesis: High OCI is associated with a rigid "Win-Stay" strategy, 
    where receiving a coin triggers a compulsive repetition of the starting choice.
    
    Parameters:
    lr: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] Mixing weight.
    stick_rew_base: [0, 5] Base stickiness after a reward.
    oci_stick_mod: [0, 5] Modulation of rewarded stickiness by OCI.
