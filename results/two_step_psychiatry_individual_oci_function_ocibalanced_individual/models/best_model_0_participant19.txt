    """
    Reinforcement Learning with OCI-modulated Choice Stickiness.
    
    This model focuses on the tendency to repeat previous choices (perseveration).
    It assumes that higher OCI scores lead to higher 'stickiness' in the first-stage choice,
    making the participant more resistant to switching strategies even after negative outcomes.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Update rate for Q-values [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice [0, 10].
    - stick_param: Base stickiness magnitude [0, 5].
    
    The effective stickiness added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action is:
    stick_eff = stick_param * (1 + oci)
    
    This creates a bias towards repeating the last action taken at Stage 1.
