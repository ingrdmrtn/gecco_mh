    Model-Free RL with OCI-modulated Choice Autocorrelation (Stickiness).
    
    Hypothesis: High OCI leads to repetitive behavior (perseveration). This model
    adds a "stickiness" bonus directly to the choice logits of the previously
    selected action, with the strength of this bonus determined by OCI.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Speed of value updating.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - stickiness_oci_slope: [0, 5] How much OCI increases the tendency to repeat choices.
    - stickiness_intercept: [-2, 2] Base tendency to repeat (or switch) at OCI=0.
