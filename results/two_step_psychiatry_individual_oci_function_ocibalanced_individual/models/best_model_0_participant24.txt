    Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free RL with OCI-modulated mixing weight.
    
    The balance between Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) control at Stage 1
    is determined by a mixing weight 'w'. This weight is linearly modulated by the 
    participant's OCI score, testing if symptom severity shifts the balance 
    between goal-directed planning and habitual responding.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    - w_base: [0, 1] Base weight for Model-Based control (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB).
    - w_oci_slope: [-1, 1] How strongly OCI affects the MB/MF balance.
