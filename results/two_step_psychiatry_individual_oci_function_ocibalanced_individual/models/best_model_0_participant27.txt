    Pure Model-Based Agent with OCI-modulated Stickiness.
    
    Hypothesis: OCI score drives choice perseveration (stickiness). 
    Higher OCI leads to a higher tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 action,
    independent of the model-based value calculation.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    stick_base: [0, 5] Baseline tendency to repeat choice.
    stick_oci_sens: [0, 5] Sensitivity of stickiness to OCI score.
