    Model 1: OCI-Modulated Habit Formation.
    
    This model assumes that higher OCI scores lead to a stronger reliance on Model-Free (habitual)
    learning over Model-Based (goal-directed) planning. The mixing weight 'w' is dynamically 
    adjusted by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    w_base: [0, 1] - Baseline weighting for Model-Based control (1=Pure MB, 0=Pure MF).
    
    The effective 'w' is calculated as: w_base * (1 - oci_score).
    High OCI reduces the effective w, increasing model-free influence.
