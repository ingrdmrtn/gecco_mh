    Model 2: OCI-modulated Choice Stickiness.
    
    This model is a pure Model-Free learner but includes a 'stickiness' parameter 
    that biases the agent to repeat the last chosen action at Stage 1.
    The magnitude of this stickiness is scaled by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1]
    - beta: [0, 10]
    - stickiness_base: [-5, 5] Base tendency to repeat (positive) or switch (negative).
    - stickiness_oci: [0, 5] Additional stickiness contributed by OCI score.
