Here are three cognitive models that incorporate the participant's high OCI (Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory) score into the decision-making process.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Habit Formation (Model-Free Bias)
This model posits that individuals with high OCI scores rely more heavily on habit-based (model-free) learning rather than goal-directed (model-based) planning. The `w` parameter, which usually governs the balance between Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) control, is modulated by the OCI score. A higher OCI score pushes the weight `w` towards 0 (pure model-free), reflecting a tendency towards repetitive, habitual behavior often seen in compulsion.

```python

    """
    Model 1: OCI-Modulated Habit Formation.
    
    This model assumes that higher OCI scores lead to a stronger reliance on Model-Free (habitual)
    learning over Model-Based (goal-directed) planning. The mixing weight 'w' is dynamically 
    adjusted by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    w_base: [0, 1] - Baseline weighting for Model-Based control (1=Pure MB, 0=Pure MF).
    
    The effective 'w' is calculated as: w_base * (1 - oci_score).
    High OCI reduces the effective w, increasing model-free influence.

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Stickiness (Perseveration)
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores manifest as "stickiness" or perseveration—a compulsion to repeat the previous action regardless of the reward outcome. The OCI score scales a `stickiness` parameter added to the Q-values of the previously chosen action. High OCI leads to higher choice repetition.

### Model 3: OCI-Inflated Learning Rate (Hyper-reactivity)
This model suggests that high OCI scores relate to an over-sensitivity to prediction errors, particularly negative ones (fear of failure/imperfection). The learning rate `alpha` is modified by the OCI score. A high OCI score increases the learning rate, making the agent "jumpy" and causing them to change estimates rapidly based on the most recent outcome, rather than integrating over time.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    The base learning rate is scaled up by the OCI score. This reflects a cognitive 
    style where the participant weighs recent evidence too heavily (potential 
    anxiety/uncertainty intolerance).

    alpha_base: [0, 1] - Base learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10]
