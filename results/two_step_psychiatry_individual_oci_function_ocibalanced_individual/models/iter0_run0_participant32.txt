Here are three cognitive models that incorporate the OCI-R score into the decision-making process of the two-step task.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Balance
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores (indicative of compulsivity) lead to a deficit in goal-directed (Model-Based) control, favoring habitual (Model-Free) control. The `w` parameter, which controls the balance between these systems, is modulated by the participant's OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free with OCI-modulated weight (w).
    
    Hypothesis: Higher OCI scores reduce the contribution of the Model-Based system (goal-directed),
    making the participant rely more on Model-Free (habitual) values.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate (alpha): [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    w_base: [0, 1] Baseline mixing weight (0 = pure MF, 1 = pure MB).
    w_oci_slope: [-1, 1] How strongly OCI affects the mixing weight w.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_base, w_oci_slope = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]
    
    # Calculate effective w based on OCI. Bounded between 0 and 1.
    # If slope is negative, higher OCI leads to lower w (more habitual).
    w = w_base + (w_oci_slope * oci_score)
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    # Initialize values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) # Model-free values for stage 1 (Spaceships)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Model-free values for stage 2 (Aliens)
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- STAGE 1 CHOICE ---

        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        # Softmax Policy
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Perseveration
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores are associated with "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous action regardless of reward history. The OCI score scales the perseveration parameter `p`.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    'perseveration bonus' to the previously chosen action, scaled by OCI.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for stage 2 values.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    pers_base: [-2, 2] Baseline tendency to repeat choice (positive) or switch (negative).

    learning_rate, beta, pers_base, pers_oci_sens = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]
    
    # Calculate effective perseveration parameter
    # Higher OCI = Higher tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 action
    perseveration_weight = pers_base + (pers_oci_sens * oci_score)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate Asymmetry
This model hypothesizes that individuals with high OCI scores might learn differently from positive versus negative prediction errors (e.g., being hyper-sensitive to errors or lack of reward). The OCI score shifts the learning rate specifically for negative prediction errors (disappointment).

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    is a function of OCI.
    
    Parameters:
    alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors (RPE > 0).
    alpha_neg_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate for negative prediction errors.
