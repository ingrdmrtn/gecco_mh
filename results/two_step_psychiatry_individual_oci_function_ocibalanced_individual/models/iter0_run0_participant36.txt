Here are three cognitive models designed to capture the behavior of a participant with high obsessive-compulsive symptoms (high OCI score) in the two-step task.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Balance
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores correlate with a rigidity that favors habitual (model-free) control over goal-directed (model-based) planning. The `w` parameter (mixing weight) is modulated by the OCI score, where higher OCI pushes the agent towards model-free reinforcement learning.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free RL with OCI-modulated mixing weight.
    
    Hypothesis: Higher OCI scores reduce the reliance on model-based (planning) strategies,
    pushing the participant towards model-free (habitual) control. The mixing weight 'w'
    is derived from a base parameter and shifted by the OCI score.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice (exploration/exploitation).
    - w_base: [0, 1] Baseline weight for model-based control (0=pure MF, 1=pure MB).
    - oci_sensitivity: [0, 1] Strength of OCI's negative impact on model-based weighting.

    # Calculate effective mixing weight w. 
    # High OCI reduces w (more MF), low OCI increases w (more MB).
    # We clip to ensure it stays in [0, 1].
    w = w_base - (current_oci * oci_sensitivity)
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)

        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        
        # Store probability of the chosen action (0 or 1)
        # Action data is 0.0 or 1.0, cast to int for indexing

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Perseveration
This model posits that obsessive-compulsive traits manifest as "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous action regardless of reward history. The OCI score directly scales the `stickiness` parameter added to the Q-values.

```python

    Q-value of the previously chosen action.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate.

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)

    last_action_1 = -1 

    # Calculate total stickiness bonus based on OCI
    # Higher OCI = Higher tendency to repeat

### Model 3: OCI-Influenced Learning Rates (Separate Positive/Negative)
This model suggests that high OCI scores alter how individuals process positive versus negative feedback (anxiety/avoidance vs. reward seeking). The model splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`. The OCI score is used to bias the ratio between these two, hypothesizing that high OCI individuals might be hyper-sensitive to negative prediction errors (punishment/lack of reward).

```python

    vs negative (no reward) outcomes. This model scales the learning rate for 
    negative prediction errors (alpha_neg) upwards based on the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - neg_bias_strength: [0, 1] How much OCI amplifies learning from negative outcomes.
