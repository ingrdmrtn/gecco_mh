Here are three cognitive models designed to explain the participant's behavior, incorporating their high OCI-R score into the decision-making mechanics.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weight (`cognitive_model1`)

**Concept:** This model posits that individuals with high OCI scores (like this participant) may rely more heavily on habit (Model-Free learning) and less on goal-directed planning (Model-Based learning) due to cognitive rigidity or compulsivity. The `w` parameter, which controls the balance between Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) systems, is modulated by the OCI score. Specifically, higher OCI reduces the influence of the Model-Based system.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid RL model where the balance between Model-Based and Model-Free control (w)
    is modulated by the OCI score. High OCI reduces Model-Based influence.

    beta: [0, 10]
    w_base: [0, 1] - Baseline mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB)
    oci_sensitivity: [0, 5] - How strongly OCI reduces MB control

    # We clip to ensure it stays between 0 and 1
    w_effective = w_base * (1.0 / (1.0 + oci_sensitivity * oci_score))

    # Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # Model-free values for stage 1 (Spaceships)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Model-free values for stage 2 (Aliens)
    
    for trial in range(n_trials):
        
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Model-Based calculation: V_MB(s1) = T * max(Q_stage2)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        q_net = w_effective * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w_effective) * q_stage1_mf

### Model 2: Perseveration Bias Model (`cognitive_model2`)

**Concept:** Individuals with compulsive tendencies often exhibit "stickiness" or perseveration—repeating the previous choice regardless of reward. This model introduces a perseveration parameter `stickiness` that is scaled by the OCI score. A high OCI score amplifies the tendency to repeat the last action taken at Stage 1, making behavior more rigid and less sensitive to recent outcomes.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    High OCI increases the bonus added to the previously chosen option.

    beta: [0, 10]

    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]
    
    # Calculate effective stickiness
    stickiness_effective = stickiness_base + (oci_amp * oci_score)
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    last_action_1 = -1 # No previous action for first trial
    
    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Add stickiness bonus to Q-values before softmax
        q_stage1_with_stickiness = q_stage1_mf.copy()
        
        if last_action_1 != -1:
            q_stage1_with_stickiness[last_action_1] += stickiness_effective

### Model 3: Punishment Sensitivity Model (`cognitive_model3`)

**Concept:** Compulsivity is often linked to anxiety and harm avoidance. This model suggests that high OCI individuals learn differently from positive rewards vs. lack of rewards (punishments/omissions). Specifically, this model splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`. The OCI score shifts the bias such that high OCI individuals have a higher learning rate for negative outcomes (0 coins), reacting more strongly to failure.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Dual learning rate model where OCI increases sensitivity to negative outcomes (0 reward).
    
    Bounds:
