Here are three new cognitive models designed to capture decision-making in the two-step task, specifically incorporating the OCI score to modulate reinforcement learning and model-based planning processes.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weight (`w`)
This model assumes that individuals with different OCI scores rely differently on Model-Based (planning) vs. Model-Free (habitual) systems. The parameter `w` controls the balance between these two systems. Here, the OCI score directly scales the `w` parameter, testing the hypothesis that compulsivity (even at low levels like 0.3) might correlate with a shift towards habitual (model-free) control or rigid planning.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free RL with OCI-modulated mixing weight.
    
    The balance between Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) control is determined by 
    parameter `w`. This model posits that the effective `w` is influenced by the 
    participant's OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Learning rate for value updates [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice [0, 10].
    - w_base: Base weighting for Model-Based control [0, 1].
    - oci_mod: Strength of OCI modulation on the mixing weight [0, 1].

    # Calculate effective w. We constrain it to [0, 1].
    # Hypothesis: OCI might reduce flexibility/MB planning, or conversely increase rigid planning.
    # Here we model it as a modulation: w_eff = w_base * (1 +/- oci * mod). 
    # Let's assume OCI reduces MB control (shifting to habits).
    w = w_base * (1.0 - (oci_score * oci_mod))
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

### Model 2: Perseveration Model with OCI-Dependent Stickiness
This model investigates whether the OCI score relates to "stickiness" or perseveration—the tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward history. This is a common feature in compulsivity, where behavior can become repetitive.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Learning rate [0, 1].
    - beta: Inverse temperature [0, 10].
    - stickiness_base: Base tendency to repeat the last choice [0, 5].
    - oci_sticky_slope: How strongly OCI increases stickiness [0, 5].

    oci_score = oci[0]

    # Calculate effective stickiness
    # Hypothesis: Higher OCI leads to higher perseveration.

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Inverse Temperature (Exploration/Exploitation)
This model posits that OCI affects the randomness of choice (exploration vs. exploitation). A common finding in compulsivity research is either rigid behavior (high beta) or noisy/inconsistent behavior (low beta). This model allows the `beta` parameter to scale linearly with the OCI score.

```python
import numpy as np

    The inverse temperature (beta) controls the trade-off between exploitation 
    (choosing the best option) and exploration (choosing randomly).

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Learning rate [0, 1].
    - beta_intercept: Baseline inverse temperature [0, 10].

        # Update Stage 1 with eligibility trace (lambda)

        delta_stage1 = q_stage2[s_idx, a2] - q_stage1[a1]
        
        # Combining immediate stage 1 error with stage 2 error passed back
        q_stage1[a1] += learning_rate * delta_stage1 + (lambd * learning_rate * delta_stage2)
