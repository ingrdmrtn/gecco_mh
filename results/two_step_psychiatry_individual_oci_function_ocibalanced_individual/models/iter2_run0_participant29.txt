Here are the 3 proposed cognitive models as Python functions.

### Model 1: Hybrid MB/MF with OCI-modulated Mixing Weight
This model posits that Obsessive-Compulsive symptoms (OCI) alter the balance between Goal-Directed (Model-Based) and Habitual (Model-Free) control. It includes a choice stickiness parameter to account for perseveration. The mixing weight `w` is modulated linearly by OCI.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free RL with OCI-modulated mixing weight.
    
    The balance between Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habit) systems is determined by 'w'.
    This model assumes OCI score modulates 'w', shifting the user along the Goal-Habit continuum.
    It also includes a constant stickiness parameter (perseveration).

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate of updating MF values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
    stickiness: [-5, 5] - Tendency to repeat the previous stage 1 choice.
    w_base: [0, 1] - Baseline mixing weight (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB) at OCI=0.
    w_oci_slope: [-1, 1] - Change in mixing weight per unit of OCI.

### Model 2: Hybrid MB/MF with OCI-modulated Learning Rate
This model posits that OCI affects the *plasticity* of the habitual system. Instead of changing the strategy balance, OCI changes how quickly the Model-Free values are updated (learning rate). High OCI might lead to rigid habits (low alpha) or volatile updating (high alpha).

    """
    Model 2: Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free RL with OCI-modulated Learning Rate.
    
    Here, the mixing weight 'w' and 'stickiness' are constant across OCI levels.
    However, the learning rate 'alpha' is modulated by OCI.
    
    Parameters:
    lr_base: [0, 1] - Base learning rate.
    lr_oci_slope: [-1, 1] - Modulation of learning rate by OCI.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.

    current_oci = oci[0]

    # Calculate effective learning rate, clipped to [0, 1]
    learning_rate = lr_base + (lr_oci_slope * current_oci)
    learning_rate = np.clip(learning_rate, 0.0, 1.0)

### Model 3: Hybrid MB/MF with OCI-modulated Stickiness
This model posits that OCI specifically drives perseverative behavior (stickiness) within a hybrid framework. Unlike the previous pure MF stickiness model, this model acknowledges that participants use a mix of strategies (`w`), but the compulsion to repeat choices is the specific component driven by OCI.
