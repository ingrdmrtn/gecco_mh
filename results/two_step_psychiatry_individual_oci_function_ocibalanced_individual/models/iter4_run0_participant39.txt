Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms by which Obsessive-Compulsive symptoms (OCI) might influence decision-making in the two-step task, specifically focusing on the balance between model-based/model-free control, learning rate asymmetries, and uncertainty-driven exploration.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with OCI-modulated Model-Based Weight (`w`)
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores reflect a deficit in goal-directed (Model-Based) control, leading to a reliance on habitual (Model-Free) strategies. The parameter `w` (weight) controls the mixture of these two systems. Here, the `w` parameter is not static but is a function of the participant's OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free learner where the weighting parameter 'w' 
    is modulated by the OCI score. 
    High OCI is hypothesized to reduce Model-Based control (lower w).

    learning_rate: [0, 1]
    beta: [0, 10]
    w_max: [0, 1] - Maximum possible model-based weight (for OCI=0)
    oci_decay: [0, 5] - Rate at which w decays as OCI increases

    learning_rate, beta, w_max, oci_decay = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]

    # Calculate effective weight w based on OCI
    # As OCI increases, w decreases (more Model-Free/Habitual)
    w = w_max * np.exp(-oci_decay * oci_score)
    w = np.clip(w, 0, 1)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # Model-Based Value calculation
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

```

### Model 2: Dual Learning Rates (Positive/Negative) Modulated by OCI
This model investigates if OCI affects how participants learn from positive versus negative outcomes (feedback sensitivity). It proposes that high OCI might lead to "hyper-learning" from negative outcomes (or lack of reward) due to anxiety or perfectionism. The model splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`, where `alpha_neg` is scaled by the OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    over-correction or hypersensitivity to missing rewards.

    alpha_pos: [0, 1] - Learning rate for positive prediction errors
    alpha_neg_base: [0, 1] - Base learning rate for negative prediction errors
    beta: [0, 10]

    alpha_pos, alpha_neg_base, beta, oci_neg_scale = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]

    # Calculate effective negative learning rate
    # Bounded to [0, 1] to maintain stability
    alpha_neg_effective = alpha_neg_base * (1 + oci_neg_scale * oci_score)
    alpha_neg_effective = np.clip(alpha_neg_effective, 0, 1)

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) # Initial values 0.5 (ambivalent)

```

### Model 3: Inverse Temperature (Beta) Modulation by OCI
This model posits that OCI affects the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Specifically, it tests the hypothesis that high OCI leads to more deterministic (rigid) behavior, represented by a higher inverse temperature parameter (`beta`). A higher beta makes the softmax function sharper, meaning the participant is less likely to explore options with slightly lower estimated values.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
