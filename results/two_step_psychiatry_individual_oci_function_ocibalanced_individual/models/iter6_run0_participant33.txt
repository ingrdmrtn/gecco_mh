Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task, incorporating OCI scores in distinct ways inspired by computational psychiatry literature (e.g., balance between model-based/model-free control, perseveration, and uncertainty).

### Model 1: OCI-modulated Model-Based Weight ($w$)
This model hypothesizes that OCI symptoms relate to the balance between goal-directed (Model-Based) and habitual (Model-Free) control. Specifically, it tests if higher OCI scores lead to a reliance on rigid, habitual (Model-Free) strategies (lower $w$) or over-deliberation (higher $w$). The parameter `w` is modeled as a linear function of OCI.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: OCI-modulated Model-Based Weight.

    is linearly related to the OCI score.
    w = w_base + (w_oci_slope * oci)
    w is clamped between [0, 1].
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - lambda_eligibility: [0, 1] Eligibility trace for Stage 1 updates.
    - w_base: [0, 1] Baseline mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB) for an OCI of 0.
    - w_oci_slope: [-1, 1] Slope of OCI effect on w.

    # Clamp w to [0, 1]
    if w < 0.0: w = 0.0
    if w > 1.0: w = 1.0

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

### Model 2: OCI-modulated Choice Stickiness (Perseveration)
This model tests the hypothesis that OCI is associated with "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward history. Here, the stickiness parameter in the softmax function is directly modulated by the OCI score.

    Parameters:

    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.

### Model 3: OCI-modulated Transition Learning Rate (State Inference)
This model posits that OCI affects how participants update their internal model of the world (the transition matrix). A high OCI might reflect hyper-vigilance to environmental changes, causing the participant to update their belief about transition probabilities ($P(State|Action)$) more rapidly than controls. This is distinct from reward learning rates.
