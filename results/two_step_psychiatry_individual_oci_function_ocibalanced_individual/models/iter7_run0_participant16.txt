Here are three new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms by which OCI scores might influence reinforcement learning in the two-step task.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Balance with Pruning
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores might lead to "over-pruning" or a restricted search space. It modifies the weighting parameter `w` (balance between Model-Based and Model-Free systems) based on OCI, but specifically links it to a pruning threshold where low-value model-based branches are ignored if OCI is high (simulating a rigid focus).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: OCI-Modulated MB/MF Balance with Pruning.
    
    This model assumes that OCI affects the balance between model-based (MB) and 
    model-free (MF) control. Specifically, it tests if higher OCI leads to a 
    more rigid (MF-dominant) or more calculated (MB-dominant) strategy.
    
    Parameters:
    lr: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w_base: [0, 1] Baseline weighting for Model-Based system (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB).
    oci_w_shift: [-1, 1] Shift in 'w' proportional to OCI score.

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # Model-free Q-values for stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Model-free Q-values for stage 2 (State x Action)

    # Calculate individual w parameter based on OCI
    # Bounded between 0 and 1
    w = w_base + (oci_score * oci_w_shift)
    if w < 0: w = 0
    if w > 1: w = 1

### Model 2: OCI-Dependent Learning Rate Asymmetry (Pos/Neg)
This model posits that OCI symptoms relate to how individuals process positive versus negative prediction errors. It allows for separate learning rates for better-than-expected outcomes (positive RPE) and worse-than-expected outcomes (negative RPE), with OCI modulating the sensitivity to negative outcomes (punishment/lack of reward).

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Eligibility Trace (Lambda)
This model introduces an eligibility trace parameter ($\lambda$) for the temporal difference learning. $\lambda$ controls how much the Stage 2 reward updates the Stage 1 choice directly (bypassing the state value). The hypothesis is that OCI might correlate with how credit is assigned to past actions—either "over-assigning" credit to distant past actions (high $\lambda$) or failing to link sequences (low $\lambda$).

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 3: OCI-Modulated Eligibility Trace (Lambda).

    partially by the Stage 2 prediction error. This links the final reward 
    directly back to the first choice. OCI modulates this 'eligibility' or 
    credit assignment strength.
