Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the OCI-R score into the decision-making process, exploring mechanisms distinct from previous attempts (like simple beta scaling or w-weighting).

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Eligibility Trace (Lambda)
This model hypothesizes that OCI scores affect the "eligibility trace" ($\lambda$) in a TD($\lambda$) reinforcement learning framework. In the two-step task, $\lambda$ controls how much the Stage 2 reward updates the Stage 1 choice directly. A higher $\lambda$ connects the outcome to the initial choice more strongly. We test if higher OCI leads to a stronger direct connection (higher $\lambda$), perhaps reflecting a compulsion to assign credit/blame to the initial action regardless of the transition structure.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    TD(lambda) learner where the eligibility trace parameter (lambda) is modulated by OCI.
    
    Hypothesis: OCI scores influence how strongly the Stage 2 outcome updates the Stage 1 value directly.
    Higher OCI might lead to stronger credit assignment (higher lambda) to the first action,
    bypassing the model-based transition structure.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - lambda_base: Baseline eligibility trace parameter.
    - lambda_oci_slope: How much OCI increases the eligibility trace.
    - w: Weighting between model-based and model-free (fixed or separate param).
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0,1]
    beta: [0,10]
    lambda_base: [0,1]
    lambda_oci_slope: [0,1] (scaled such that base + slope*oci stays approx within [0,1])
    w: [0,1]

    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]

    # Calculate effective lambda based on OCI
    eff_lambda = lambda_base + (lambda_oci_slope * oci_score)
    # Clamp lambda to [0, 1]
    eff_lambda = np.clip(eff_lambda, 0.0, 1.0)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Preservation (Stickiness)
This model tests the hypothesis that OCI is related to behavioral rigidity or "stickiness" (perseveration). Instead of affecting learning rates or model-based weights, OCI here directly scales the tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice, regardless of the reward outcome. This is a common feature in compulsivity models where habits (repeating actions) are stronger.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    (perseveration), independent of value learning.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Learning rate.
    - beta: Inverse temperature.
    - w: Weighting between model-based and model-free.
    - stick_base: Baseline stickiness parameter.

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate Asymmetry
This model investigates if OCI scores modulate how participants learn from positive versus negative prediction errors. It posits a baseline learning rate, but allows OCI to specifically amplify or dampen the learning rate for *negative* prediction errors (disappointments). This could reflect a heightened sensitivity to failure or punishment often seen in anxiety-related disorders.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    Parameters:
    - lr_base: Baseline learning rate (applied to positive RPEs and base negative).
