    Simulates choices and rewards using Model-Free RL with OCI-modulated Perseveration (Stickiness).

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, stickiness_base, oci_sticky_slope]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float or None): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score for the participant.

    Returns:
