Here is the simulation code corresponding to the provided model logic.

```python
import numpy as np

def simulate_model(
    n_trials,
    parameters,
    drift1,
    drift2,
    drift3,
    drift4,
    oci=None):
    """
    Simulates choices and rewards using the OCI-modulated Choice Stickiness model.
    
    This model is purely Model-Based (MB) in the first stage regarding value estimation,
    but adds a stickiness bonus to the previously chosen action. The magnitude of this
    bonus is modulated by the participant's OCI score.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, stickiness_base, stickiness_oci]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float or None): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score. If None, defaults to 0.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
