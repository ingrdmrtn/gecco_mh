Here is the simulation code for the `cognitive_model2` function provided.

```python
import numpy as np

def simulate_model(
    n_trials,
    parameters,
    drift1,
    drift2,
    drift3,
    drift4,
    oci=None):
    """
    Simulates choices and rewards using the Reinforcement Learning with OCI-modulated Choice Stickiness model.

    This model includes a stickiness parameter that biases the first-stage choice towards the 
    previously chosen action, with the magnitude of this bias modulated by the participant's OCI score.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, stick_param]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float or None): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score. If None, defaults to 0.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
