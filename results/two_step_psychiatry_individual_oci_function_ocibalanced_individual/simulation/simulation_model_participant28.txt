Here is the simulation code corresponding to the `cognitive_model1` fitting logic provided.

```python
import numpy as np

    parameters,
    drift1,
    drift2,
    drift3,
    drift4,
    oci=None):
    """
    Simulates choices and rewards using the hybrid RL model where the balance between 
    Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) control is modulated by the OCI score.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [lr, beta, w_base, w_oci_slope]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (list or np.ndarray): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score (expects a list/array with at least one value).

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
