Here is the simulation code corresponding to the provided model fitting function.

```python
import numpy as np

def simulate_model(
    n_trials,
    parameters,
    drift1,
    drift2,
    drift3,
    drift4,
    oci=None):
    """
    Simulates choices and rewards using Model 1: Hybrid MB/MF RL with OCI-modulated mixing weight.
    
    The balance between Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habit) systems is determined by 'w',
    which is a function of the OCI score. It uses a single learning rate for both stages and
    TD(1) logic (updating stage 1 based on the sum of prediction errors).

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, stickiness, w_base, w_oci_slope]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float or None): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score. If None, assumes 0.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
