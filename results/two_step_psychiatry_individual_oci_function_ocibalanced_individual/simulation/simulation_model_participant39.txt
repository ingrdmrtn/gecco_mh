Here is the simulation code corresponding to the provided model fitting function.

```python
import numpy as np

rng = np.random.default_rng()

def simulate_model(
    n_trials,
    parameters,
    drift1,
    drift2,
    drift3,
    drift4,
    oci=None):
    """
    Simulates choices and rewards using a Model-Free learner with OCI-modulated perseveration.
    
    The model calculates an effective stickiness parameter based on the participant's
    OCI score: stickiness_effective = stickiness_base + (oci_amp * oci_score).
    This bonus is added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action in Stage 1.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, stickiness_base, oci_amp]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities for the second stage options.
        oci (float, optional): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score. If None, defaults to 0.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
