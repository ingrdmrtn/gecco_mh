Here is the simulation code corresponding to the provided model fitting function.

```python
import numpy as np

    Simulates choices and rewards using Model 2: OCI-modulated Choice Stickiness.
    
    This model is a pure Model-Free learner but includes a 'stickiness' parameter 
    that biases the agent to repeat the last chosen action at Stage 1.
    The magnitude of this stickiness is scaled by the OCI score.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, stickiness_base, stickiness_oci]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float or None): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score for the participant.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
