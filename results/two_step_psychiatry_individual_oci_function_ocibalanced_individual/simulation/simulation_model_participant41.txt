Here is the simulation code corresponding to the OCI-Mediated Eligibility Trace model.

```python
import numpy as np

def simulate_model(
    n_trials,
    parameters,
    drift1,
    drift2,
    drift3,
    drift4,
    oci=None):
    """
    Simulates choices and rewards using Model 2: OCI-Mediated Eligibility Trace.
    
    This model uses temporal difference learning where the eligibility trace (lambda)
    depends on OCI. A higher OCI score increases lambda, meaning the Stage 1 Q-value 
    is more strongly updated by the Stage 2 Reward Prediction Error.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, lambda_scale]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float, list, or np.ndarray): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score.
                                          Can be a single float or a list/array where the first element is used.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
