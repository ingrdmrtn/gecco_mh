    Model 2: OCI-influenced Perseveration (Stickiness).
    
    This model assumes a pure Model-Free learner but adds a choice stickiness

    High OCI -> Higher tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice.

    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - stickiness_base: [0, 5] Base tendency to repeat previous choice.
