    Model-Free Learner with OCI-Dependent Choice Perseveration (Stickiness).
    
    The 'stickiness' parameter adds a bonus to the previously chosen action, 
    making repetition more likely. This bonus is scaled by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    lr : [0, 1] Learning rate.
    beta : [0, 10] Inverse temperature (shared for both stages).
    stickiness_base : [0, 5] Base tendency to repeat choices.
    stickiness_oci : [0, 5] Additional stickiness scaled by OCI.
