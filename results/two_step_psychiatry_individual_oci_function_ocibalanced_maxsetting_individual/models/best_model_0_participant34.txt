    """
    Model-Free RL with OCI-Driven Win-Stay Amplification.
    
    Hypothesis: High OCI leads to excessive repetition of rewarded actions.
    This model includes a base stickiness parameter, but adds an additional
    boost to stickiness specifically if the previous trial was rewarded.
    The magnitude of this 'win-stay' boost is scaled by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    stickiness_base: [0, 5] General tendency to repeat the last choice regardless of outcome.
    oci_winstay_boost: [0, 5] Additional stickiness added ONLY after a reward, scaled by OCI.
