Here are three cognitive models formulated as Python functions. They explore how Obsessive-Compulsive symptoms (OCI) might modulate the balance between goal-directed and habitual control, the tendency to perseverate (stickiness), and the rate of learning.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weight
This model hypothesizes that the balance between Model-Based (goal-directed) and Model-Free (habitual) control is directly influenced by the participant's OCI score. High OCI is often associated with deficits in model-based control. Here, the mixing weight $w$ is a logistic function of the OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid RL model where the balance between Model-Based and Model-Free control (w)
    is modulated by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 choice.
    - beta_2: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2 choice.
    - w_base: [-5, 5] Base logit for the mixing weight w.
    - w_oci_slope: [-5, 5] How strongly OCI affects w. Negative slope implies high OCI -> low MB.

    # Calculate mixing weight w based on OCI (Sigmoid transformation to keep 0 < w < 1)
    # w represents the weight of Model-Based control.
    w_logit = w_base + w_oci_slope * current_oci
    w = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-w_logit))

        if a1 < 0 or s_idx < 0 or a2 < 0:
            continue

```

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Perseveration
This model hypothesizes that OCI symptoms manifest as "stickiness" or perseveration—a compulsion to repeat the previous action regardless of the outcome. It adds a stickiness bonus to the Q-value of the previously chosen spaceship. The magnitude of this bonus is scaled by the OCI score.

```python

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Choice Determinism (Beta)
This model posits that OCI affects the rigidity of decision-making. Specifically, the OCI score scales the inverse temperature ($\beta$) parameters. A higher OCI might lead to higher $\beta$ (more deterministic, less exploration), reflecting the rigid behavioral patterns often seen in compulsive disorders.

    - beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature.
    - beta_oci_factor: [-5, 5] Multiplier for OCI effect on beta.
