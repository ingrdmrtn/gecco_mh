Here are three cognitive models designed to capture the behavior of the participant, incorporating their OCI-R score (0.366, representing medium obsessive-compulsive symptoms) into the decision-making logic.

### Cognitive Model 1: Hybrid Learner with OCI-Modulated Mixing
This model assumes that the balance between Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) control is influenced by the participant's OCI score. A higher OCI score might push the participant towards more habitual (Model-Free) control or rigid planning. Here, we model the mixing weight `w` as a function of the OCI score, where the OCI score scales the reliance on Model-Based planning.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free learner where the mixing weight (w) is 
    modulated by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w_base: [0,1] - Baseline weight for Model-Based control.
    w_oci_scale: [0,1] - How much OCI score reduces/increases Model-Based control.
    
    The final mixing weight is calculated as: w = w_base * (1 - w_oci_scale * oci)
    This tests the hypothesis that higher OCI leads to reduced model-based flexibility.

    participant_oci = oci[0]
    
    # Calculate effective mixing weight based on OCI
    # If w_oci_scale is high, higher OCI reduces the model-based contribution.
    w = w_base * (1.0 - w_oci_scale * participant_oci)
    # Clamp w to [0, 1]

### Cognitive Model 2: OCI-Driven Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model posits that OCI symptoms manifest as "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward. The OCI score directly scales a perseveration parameter added to the Q-values, making the model more likely to repeat the previous action if OCI is high.

```python

    oci_pers_sensitivity: [0,5] - How strongly OCI amplifies perseveration.
    
    The bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action is:

### Cognitive Model 3: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate Asymmetry
This model suggests that OCI affects how participants learn from positive versus negative prediction errors. Specifically, it tests if higher OCI leads to a stronger emphasis on negative outcomes (loss aversion or hyper-sensitivity to failure). The learning rate is split into positive and negative components, with the negative learning rate scaled by OCI.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    are asymmetric, and the negative learning rate is modulated by OCI.

    alpha_neg_base: [0,1] - Base learning rate for negative prediction errors (PE < 0).
    oci_sens: [0,1] - How much OCI increases sensitivity to negative PEs.
