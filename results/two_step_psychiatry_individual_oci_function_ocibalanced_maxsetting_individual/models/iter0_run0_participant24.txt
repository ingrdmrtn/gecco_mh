Here are three cognitive models based on the two-step task and the participant's data, incorporating the OCI score.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Balance
This model hypothesizes that the balance between Model-Based (planning based on transition structure) and Model-Free (habitual) control is influenced by the participant's OCI score. The `w` parameter (weighting between MB and MF) is modulated by OCI, suggesting that obsessive-compulsive traits might bias a participant towards more rigid habit formation (MF) or excessive planning (MB).

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with OCI modulation on the mixing weight.
    
    The balance between Model-Based (goal-directed) and Model-Free (habitual) control
    is determined by a weighting parameter 'w'. This 'w' is dynamically adjusted 
    based on the participant's OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    w_base: [0, 1] - Base weighting for Model-Based control (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB).

### Model 2: OCI-Dependent Perseveration
This model posits that OCI traits relate to "stickiness" or perseveration—the tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward. A participant with medium OCI might exhibit specific repetitive behaviors. This model adds a perseveration bonus to the Q-values of the previously chosen action, where the magnitude of this bonus is scaled by the OCI score.

    The model assumes the participant is primarily model-free but has a tendency 
    to repeat choices (perseveration). The strength of this perseveration is 
    a function of the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate Asymmetry
This model suggests that OCI scores influence how participants learn from positive versus negative prediction errors. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive traits may be hyper-sensitive to negative outcomes (avoidance learning) or positive outcomes. Here, the OCI score shifts the balance between a `learning_rate_pos` and `learning_rate_neg`.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Reinforcement Learning with Asymmetric Learning Rates modulated by OCI.
    
    The model allows for different learning rates for positive and negative 
    prediction errors. The OCI score acts as a bias parameter, shifting sensitivity 
    towards negative prediction errors (punishment/loss of reward sensitivity).
    
    Parameters:
    lr_base: [0, 1] - Base learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    asymmetry_param: [0, 1] - Determines the split between pos/neg learning rates.
    oci_bias: [0, 1] - How much OCI biases learning towards negative errors.
