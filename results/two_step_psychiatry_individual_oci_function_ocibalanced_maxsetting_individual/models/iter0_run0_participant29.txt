Here are three cognitive models designed to explain the participant's behavior, incorporating their OCI score into the decision-making process.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Balance
This model hypothesizes that the balance between Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) control is modulated by the participant's OCI score. Specifically, higher OCI scores might lead to a more rigid, habit-driven (Model-Free) strategy, or conversely, a hyper-vigilant (Model-Based) strategy. Here, we model a mixing weight `w` that shifts based on OCI.

```python

    """
    Model 1: OCI-Modulated MB/MF Balance.
    
    This model assumes behavior is a mix of Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) 
    strategies. The mixing weight 'w' is modulated by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - w_base: [0, 1] Baseline mixing weight (0=pure MF, 1=pure MB).

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

### Model 2: OCI-Influenced Learning Rate (Perseveration)
This model posits that the OCI score affects the *learning rate*. Individuals with higher OCI scores might exhibit "stickiness" or rigidity, represented by a lower learning rate (slow to update beliefs), or conversely, over-sensitivity to error. Here, the effective learning rate is a function of the base rate and the OCI score.

    - alpha_oci_mod: [-1, 1] Modulation of learning rate by OCI.

### Model 3: OCI-Driven Choice Stickiness (Perseveration)
This model introduces a "stickiness" parameter that biases the participant to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice. The magnitude of this perseveration is directly controlled by the OCI score, testing the hypothesis that OCI is linked to repetitive behaviors regardless of reward outcome.
