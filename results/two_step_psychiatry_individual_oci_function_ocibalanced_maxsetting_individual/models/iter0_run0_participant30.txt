Here are three cognitive models based on the Two-Step task, tailored to the participant's data and OCI score.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with OCI-Modulated Stickiness
**Hypothesis:** High OCI scores are associated with perseveration and repetitive behaviors. This model assumes the participant uses a standard hybrid (Model-Based + Model-Free) strategy, but their tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice ("stickiness") is directly amplified by their OCI score.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model (MB/MF) with OCI-modulated Choice Stickiness.
    
    Hypothesis: Higher OCI scores lead to higher choice perseveration (stickiness),
    regardless of reward history.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate of updating Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB).
    - stick_base: [0, 5] Base stickiness parameter, scaled by OCI.

        q_net_stick = q_net.copy()
        if last_action_1 != -1:

### Model 2: "Habitual Compulsion" Model (OCI-Suppressed MB)
**Hypothesis:** The "Habit" theory of OCD suggests that compulsivity arises from an over-reliance on the Model-Free (habit) system and a deficit in the Model-Based (goal-directed) system. This model posits that the mixing weight $w$ (degree of model-based control) is suppressed as the OCI score increases.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model where OCI score suppresses Model-Based control.
    
    Hypothesis: High OCI indicates a shift from Goal-Directed (MB) to Habitual (MF) control.
    The effective mixing weight 'w' is reduced by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1]
    - beta: [0, 10]
    - w_max: [0, 1] The maximum theoretical MB weight (if OCI were 0).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_max = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]
    
    # Effective w decreases as OCI increases
    # If OCI is high (~0.93), w_effective becomes very small (mostly MF)
    w_effective = w_max * (1.0 - oci_score)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Asymmetric Learning (Model-Free)
**Hypothesis:** High OCI scores often correlate with anxiety and fear of failure. This model assumes a pure Model-Free strategy (typical of high compulsivity) but introduces *asymmetric learning rates*. Specifically, the learning rate for negative outcomes (0 reward) is amplified by the OCI score, reflecting a hypersensitivity to "mistakes" or missed rewards.

```python

    """

    Parameters:
    - lr_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate for positive outcomes.
