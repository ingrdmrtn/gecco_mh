Here are the three cognitive models based on the provided participant data and OCI-R score.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Hybrid Control
This model hypothesizes that the balance between Model-Based (goal-directed) and Model-Free (habitual) control is modulated by the participant's obsessive-compulsive symptoms. High OCI scores are often associated with a bias towards habitual control. The parameter `w` (weight for Model-Based values) is a function of the OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    OCI-Modulated Hybrid Model.
    
    The weight (w) determining the balance between Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) 
    systems is modulated by the OCI score.
    w = w_base + (2 * w_oci_coeff - 1) * oci
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate for MF values.
    - beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice policy.
    - w_base: [0,1] Baseline weight for MB control (intercept).
    - w_oci_coeff: [0,1] Coefficient for OCI modulation on w. 
      Mapped to range [-1, 1] to allow OCI to increase or decrease MB control.

```

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores relate to "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of the outcome. The model includes a choice autocorrelation parameter (`stickiness`) that is modulated by the OCI score.

```python

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate
This model hypothesizes that OCI symptoms affect the speed of learning (e.g., via hyper-vigilance or cognitive inflexibility). The learning rate $\alpha$ is modulated by the OCI score.
