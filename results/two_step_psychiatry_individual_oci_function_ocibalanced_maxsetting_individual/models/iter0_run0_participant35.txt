Here are three cognitive models formulated as Python functions. They all build upon the standard hybrid reinforcement learning framework (Model-Based + Model-Free) but incorporate the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI) score in distinct, theoretically motivated ways.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weight
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores correlate with a deficit in Model-Based (goal-directed) control. The parameter `w` (the weight given to the model-based system) is not fixed but is a function of the participant's OCI score. Higher OCI reduces the reliance on the transition matrix structure, shifting control toward the Model-Free (habitual) system.

```python

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation trade-off).
    - w_intercept: [0, 1] Baseline Model-Based weight for a participant with 0 OCI.

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model hypothesizes that OCI is linked to "stickiness" or perseveration—a compulsion to repeat the previous action regardless of the outcome. The model adds a "stickiness" bonus to the Q-value of the previously chosen spaceship. The magnitude of this bonus is scaled by the OCI score.

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Inverse Temperature (Rigidity)
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores relate to "rigidity" or an intolerance of uncertainty, manifesting as a higher inverse temperature ($\beta$). A higher $\beta$ makes the softmax function sharper, meaning the participant is more likely to deterministically choose the option with the slightly higher value, exploring less.
