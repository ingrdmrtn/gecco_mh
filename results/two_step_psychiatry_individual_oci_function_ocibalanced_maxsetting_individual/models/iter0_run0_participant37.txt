Here are the three cognitive models in Python functions.

### Cognitive Model 1: OCI-Constrained Hybrid Model
**Hypothesis:** High obsessive-compulsive symptoms (high OCI) are associated with a deficit in Model-Based (goal-directed) control. This model assumes the participant's balance between Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) control is constrained by their OCI score. Specifically, the mixing weight $w$ (where $w=1$ is full MB) is capped or scaled down by the OCI score.
**OCI Usage:** The mixing weight $w$ is calculated as $w = w_{factor} \times (1 - OCI)$. A participant with high OCI will necessarily have a lower contribution of model-based values, relying more on model-free habits.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model where the Model-Based weight is constrained by OCI.
    High OCI scores reduce the effective weight of Model-Based planning.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0,1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta_1: [0,10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 softmax.
    - beta_2: [0,10] Inverse temperature for Stage 2 softmax.
    - lam: [0,1] Eligibility trace decay parameter.
    - w_factor: [0,1] Scaling factor for the mixing weight. w = w_factor * (1 - OCI).
    - stickiness: [0,10] Bonus added to the previously chosen spaceship.

    # Mixing weight w is constrained by OCI. 
    # High OCI -> Lower w -> More Model-Free.

        if a1 < 0 or s_idx < 0 or a2 < 0:
            continue

        # Calculate Model-Based values

        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Calculate Net values (Hybrid + Stickiness)
        q_net_1 = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf

### Cognitive Model 2: OCI-Driven Stickiness Model
**Hypothesis:** High OCI is associated with repetitive, compulsive behaviors (perseveration). This model assumes the participant is purely Model-Free (habitual) but has a "stickiness" (tendency to repeat the last choice) that is directly scaled by their OCI score.
**OCI Usage:** The stickiness parameter is not free but is defined as $\rho = \rho_{factor} \times OCI$. This implies that a participant with OCI=0 would have no stickiness, while high OCI leads to high stickiness.

```python
import numpy as np

    """

    oci_score = oci[0]
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    
    # Stickiness is derived from OCI
    stickiness = stick_factor * oci_score

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

### Cognitive Model 3: OCI-Modulated Asymmetric Learning
**Hypothesis:** OCI relates to altered sensitivity to feedback (e.g., punishment sensitivity or fear of failure). This model assumes a Model-Free learner who processes positive and negative prediction errors with different learning rates, where the degree of asymmetry is modulated by OCI.
**OCI Usage:** The learning rate for negative prediction errors ($\alpha_{neg}$) is modified by OCI relative to the positive learning rate ($\alpha_{pos}$). Specifically, $\alpha_{neg} = \alpha_{pos} \times (1 + \gamma \times OCI)$. If $\gamma > 0$, higher OCI leads to stronger learning from disappointments (negative RPEs).

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
