Here are the three cognitive models based on the provided participant data and task description.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated MB/MF Balance
This model hypothesizes that the balance between Model-Based (goal-directed) and Model-Free (habitual) control is mediated by the OCI score. High OCI scores are associated with compulsivity and a reliance on habits. Therefore, the weighting parameter $w$ (where $w=1$ is pure Model-Based and $w=0$ is pure Model-Free) is scaled down by the OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Reinforcement Learning model where the Model-Based/Model-Free weighting (w)
    is modulated by the OCI score.
    
    Hypothesis: High OCI (compulsivity) reduces Model-Based control, leading to 
    more habitual behavior. w is calculated as w_max * (1 - OCI).
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate for value updates.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w_max: [0, 1] - The maximum weight for Model-Based control (at OCI=0).
    lambda_decay: [0, 1] - Eligibility trace decay for Model-Free updates.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_max, lambda_decay = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]
    
    # OCI modulates w: Higher OCI -> Lower w (More Model-Free)
    w = w_max * (1.0 - oci_score)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # state x action

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # Skip missing data

        # Net Value: Weighted sum of MB and MF

```

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Stickiness
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores lead to "stickiness" or perseveration in choice, independent of reward history. A choice repetition bonus is added to the Q-values in Stage 1, and the magnitude of this bonus is proportional to the OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    choice (compulsive repetition). A stickiness bonus is added to the utility 
    of the previously chosen action, scaled by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1]
    beta: [0, 10]
    w: [0, 1] - Mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB).

```

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Habit Formation (Lambda)
This model hypothesizes that OCI affects the efficiency of habit formation via the eligibility trace parameter $\lambda$. A higher $\lambda$ allows the outcome of the second stage to more strongly reinforce the first stage choice directly, characteristic of strong habit formation.

    modeled by increasing the eligibility trace lambda, which controls how much 
    the Stage 2 reward updates the Stage 1 Model-Free value directly.
