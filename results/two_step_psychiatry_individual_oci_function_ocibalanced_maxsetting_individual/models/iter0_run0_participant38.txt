Here are three cognitive models designed to capture the behavior of the participant, particularly focusing on their high OCI-R score (0.783), which suggests high compulsivity or habit formation.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with OCI-Modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Balance
This model assumes that high OCI scores shift the balance between Model-Based (goal-directed) and Model-Free (habitual) control. A high OCI score (like 0.78) acts as a weight, pushing the participant more towards Model-Free learning, which relies on simple cached values rather than the transition structure of the task.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid learner where the mixing weight (w) between Model-Based and Model-Free
    systems is modulated by the OCI score. Higher OCI leads to lower w (more Model-Free).
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w_baseline: [0,1] - Baseline weight for Model-Based control before OCI modulation.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_baseline = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]
    
    # OCI modulation: High OCI reduces reliance on model-based planning.
    # We clip w to be between 0 and 1.
    # If OCI is high (~0.8), w becomes smaller, favoring Model-Free.
    w = w_baseline * (1.0 - oci_score)
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)

    # Transition matrix (fixed for this task structure)
    # A -> X (0.7), U -> Y (0.7) usually implies diagonal dominance if aligned 0->0, 1->1
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) # Model-free values for stage 1
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Values for stage 2 (2 states, 2 actions)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        a1 = int(action_1[trial])
        s_idx = int(state[trial])
        a2 = int(action_2[trial])
        r = reward[trial]

        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Model-Based value calculation: T * max(Q2)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Hybrid value
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[a1]

        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---
        # Standard Model-Free choice at stage 2
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[s_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[a2]

        # --- Learning ---
        # SARSA(0) / TD updates

        delta_stage2 = r - q_stage2_mf[s_idx, a2]
        q_stage2_mf[s_idx, a2] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Perseveration Model with OCI-Driven Stickiness
This model posits that high OCI scores manifest as "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of the reward outcome. The OCI score directly scales the `stickiness` parameter, making high-OCI participants more likely to repeat their Stage 1 choice.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free learner with choice perseveration (stickiness).
    The magnitude of stickiness is scaled by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    stickiness_base: [0,5] - Base tendency to repeat the last choice.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, stickiness_base = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]

    # Calculate effective stickiness based on OCI
    # High OCI -> Higher tendency to repeat previous choice
    stickiness = stickiness_base * (1.0 + oci_score)

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    last_action_1 = -1 # Initialize with impossible action

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        a1 = int(action_1[trial])
        s_idx = int(state[trial])
        a2 = int(action_2[trial])
        r = reward[trial]

        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Add stickiness bonus to the Q-value of the previously chosen action
        q_net = np.copy(q_stage1_mf)
        if last_action_1 != -1:
            q_net[last_action_1] += stickiness

        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[a1]

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate Asymmetry (Positive/Negative)
This model suggests that high OCI scores distort how participants learn from positive versus negative prediction errors. Specifically, it tests the hypothesis that high compulsivity leads to a heightened sensitivity to punishment (or lack of reward) or a rigidity where learning rates decrease as OCI increases. Here, we model OCI as dampening the learning rate for positive outcomes (rigidity/anhedonia aspect) while keeping negative learning intact, or vice versa.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model where learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors 
    are split, and the OCI score dampens the overall plasticity (learning rate magnitude).
    
    Parameters:
    alpha_pos_base: [0,1] - Base learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    alpha_neg_base: [0,1] - Base learning rate for negative prediction errors.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    oci_dampening: [0,1] - How much OCI reduces plasticity (0=none, 1=full dampening).
