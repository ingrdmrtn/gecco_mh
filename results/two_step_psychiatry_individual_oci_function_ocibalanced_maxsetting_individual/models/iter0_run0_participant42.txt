Here are three cognitive models formulated as Python functions. These models incorporate the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI) score to explain the participant's decision-making process, specifically focusing on the balance between goal-directed (Model-Based) and habitual (Model-Free) control, as well as perseveration and learning sensitivity.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Habitual Control
**Concept:** This model posits that high OCI scores are associated with a deficit in Model-Based (goal-directed) control, leading to a reliance on Model-Free (habitual) learning. The parameter `w` (mixing weight) is not fixed but is constrained by the OCI score. A higher OCI score effectively dampens the Model-Based weight, forcing the participant to rely more on the Model-Free system (consistent with the "Win-Stay" behavior seen in the data despite rare transitions).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    OCI-Modulated Habitual Control Model.
    
    The balance between Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) control is modulated by OCI.
    High OCI scores reduce the weight of the MB system, leading to habitual behavior.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0,1] Rate of updating value estimates.
    - beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature for softmax (choice consistency).
    - w_max: [0,1] The maximum possible weight for Model-Based control. 
             The effective w is calculated as: w_max * (1 - oci).

    w = w_max * (1.0 - oci_score)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)      # Model-free values for stage 1 (Spaceships)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Model-free values for stage 2 (Aliens per Planet)

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Perseveration
**Concept:** OCD is characterized by repetitive behaviors (compulsions). This model assumes the participant has a "stickiness" or perseveration bias that is directly proportional to their OCI score. Regardless of the learning mechanism (Hybrid MB/MF), the participant receives an additional "bonus" to the Q-value of the action chosen in the previous trial. High OCI implies high stickiness, explaining runs of identical choices.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    independent of reward history.

    - learning_rate: [0,1]
    - beta: [0,10]

### Model 3: OCI-Sensitive Hyper-Learning
**Concept:** This model suggests that high OCI scores relate to hyper-sensitivity to prediction errors (uncertainty). The learning rate `alpha` is not fixed but is amplified by the OCI score. A high OCI participant updates their internal values more drastically in response to rewards and omissions (volatile learning), potentially leading to the switching behavior seen after losses in the data.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    OCI-Sensitive Hyper-Learning Model.
    
    The learning rate is modulated by the OCI score. High OCI participants 
    are assumed to be hyper-sensitive to prediction errors (both positive and negative),
    resulting in a higher effective learning rate.
    
    Parameters:
    - base_lr: [0,1] Baseline learning rate.
    - beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0,1] Weight between MB and MF.
