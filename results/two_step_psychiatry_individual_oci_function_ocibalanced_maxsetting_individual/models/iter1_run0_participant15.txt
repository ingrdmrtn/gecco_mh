Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the OCI score to explain participant behavior in the two-step task.

### Cognitive Model 1: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate
This model hypothesizes that the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms affects the rate at which the participant updates their value estimates (learning rate). A higher or lower learning rate can reflect either a rigid adherence to prior beliefs (low alpha) or a tendency to over-adjust to recent outcomes (high alpha). It also includes a fixed stickiness parameter to account for the general tendency to repeat choices.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with OCI-modulated Learning Rate and Fixed Stickiness.
    
    Hypothesis: OCI score modulates the learning rate (alpha).
    - alpha = alpha_base + alpha_oci * oci
    - Includes fixed perseveration (stickiness).
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_base: [0, 1] Baseline learning rate.
    - alpha_oci: [-1, 1] Effect of OCI on learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - stickiness: [0, 5] Bonus added to the previous chosen action.

### Cognitive Model 2: OCI-Modulated Inverse Temperature
This model hypothesizes that OCI scores relate to the level of decision noise or determinism (beta). High OCI might correlate with a more deterministic strategy (high beta) due to anxiety driving rigid choices, or conversely, more erratic behavior (low beta). It maintains a fixed stickiness parameter.

### Cognitive Model 3: OCI-Modulated Mixing Weight with Stickiness
This model posits that OCI affects the balance between Model-Based (goal-directed) and Model-Free (habitual) control. Unlike previous attempts that modulated `w` without stickiness, this model includes a fixed stickiness parameter, acknowledging that perseveration is a distinct but co-occurring phenomenon with strategy selection.
