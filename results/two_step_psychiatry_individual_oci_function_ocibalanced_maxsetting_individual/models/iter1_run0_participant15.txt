Here are three new cognitive models based on the participant's data and OCI score.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with OCI-Modulated Stickiness
This model hypothesizes that the participant uses a hybrid strategy (combining Model-Based and Model-Free learning) but exhibits choice perseveration ("stickiness") that is directly scaled by their OCI score. This builds on the previous best model by adding the Model-Based component, which accounts for the task's transition structure, while maintaining the hypothesis that OCI drives repetitive behavior.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model (MB/MF) with choice perseveration (stickiness) scaled by OCI.
    
    Parameters:
    lr: [0, 1] Learning rate for MF values.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
    w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB).
    stick_oci: [0, 5] Perseveration bonus coefficient scaled by OCI score.
    """

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Model-Free Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) # Q(s1, a)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Q(s2, a)
    
    last_action_1 = -1

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- STAGE 1 CHOICE ---
        # Model-Based Value: T * max(Q_stage2)
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Hybrid Model with OCI-Modulated Rigidity (Beta)
This model posits that OCI affects the "inverse temperature" (beta) parameter rather than the learning or weighting mechanism. A higher OCI score leads to a higher beta, resulting in more deterministic (rigid) choices and less exploration. This tests if the compulsive symptoms manifest as an intolerance for randomness in decision-making.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control.

### Model 3: Hybrid Model with OCI-Modulated Learning Rate
This model proposes that OCI correlates with the speed of value updating (plasticity). High OCI might lead to cognitive inflexibility (lower learning rate) or hyper-reactivity (higher learning rate). The effective learning rate is a linear function of the OCI score.

    lr_oci: [0, 1] Scaling of learning rate with OCI (lr = lr_base + lr_oci*oci).
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control.
