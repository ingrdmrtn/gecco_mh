Here are three cognitive models based on the participant's data and OCI score.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate
**Hypothesis:** OCI scores relate to cognitive plasticity. This model hypothesizes that the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory score modulates the *learning rate* (how quickly values are updated). A participant with higher OCI might exhibit hyper-plasticity (over-adjusting to noise) or rigidity (under-adjusting). The stickiness parameter is included as a constant to account for the observed choice repetition in the data.

import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model where Learning Rate is modulated by OCI score.
    
    Hypothesis: The rate at which the participant updates value estimates (plasticity)
    is a function of their OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    lr_base: [0, 1] - Baseline learning rate.
    lr_oci_slope: [-1, 1] - How OCI changes the learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting between Model-Based (1) and Model-Free (0).
    stickiness: [-5, 5] - Choice perseveration bonus.

    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Inverse Temperature (Decision Rigidity)
**Hypothesis:** OCI scores relate to decision rigidity or determinism. This model posits that the OCI score affects the `beta` (inverse temperature) parameter. A higher OCI might lead to higher `beta` (more deterministic, rigid choices, less exploration), or potentially lower `beta` (more random). This separates the *speed* of learning (constant LR) from the *consistency* of choice (OCI-modulated Beta).

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rates with OCI-Modulated Stickiness
**Hypothesis:** This model combines the previously successful "OCI-stickiness" mechanism with "Asymmetric Learning Rates". It assumes that participants learn differently from positive rewards (1 coin) versus neutral outcomes (0 coins), a common feature in reinforcement learning. OCI specifically drives the *stickiness* (perseveration), while the learning asymmetry handles the valuation dynamics. This captures the long streaks in the data (stickiness) and the response to wins/losses (asymmetric LR).

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    Hypothesis: Participants update values differently for rewards vs. non-rewards.
    OCI score specifically predicts the tendency to repeat choices (stickiness),
    independent of the value learning process.

    lr_pos: [0, 1] - Learning rate for rewarded trials (outcome = 1).
    lr_neg: [0, 1] - Learning rate for unrewarded trials (outcome = 0).
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
