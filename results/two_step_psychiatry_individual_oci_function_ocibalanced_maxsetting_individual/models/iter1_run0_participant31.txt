Here are 3 new cognitive models that incorporate the OCI score to explain the participant's behavior in the two-step task.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Learning Rates (Asymmetric Updating)
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores (associated with compulsivity) might lead to an over-sensitivity to negative outcomes (punishment) or a rigidity in updating values. Here, OCI modulates the learning rate for negative prediction errors (when reward is 0), creating an asymmetry relative to positive updates.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: OCI-Modulated Asymmetric Learning Rates.
    
    This model posits that OCI affects how strongly participants learn from 
    negative outcomes (zero reward) versus positive outcomes.
    
    The learning rate for negative prediction errors (lr_neg) is modulated by OCI:
    lr_neg = lr_base * (1 + oci_sensitivity * oci)
    The learning rate for positive prediction errors is just lr_base.
    
    Parameters:
    lr_base: [0, 1] - Base learning rate for positive outcomes.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    oci_sensitivity: [0, 1] - Scaling factor for how much OCI boosts negative learning.
    w: [0, 1] - Mixing weight for Model-Based (1) vs Model-Free (0) control.

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Choice Stickiness (Perseveration)
This model assumes that compulsivity (OCI) manifests as "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous action regardless of the reward outcome.

    scaled by the OCI score. High OCI leads to higher perseveration 
    (repeating the previous Stage 1 choice).
    
    Stickiness bonus = stick_base + (stick_oci_scale * oci)
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] - MB/MF mixing weight.

    # We assume a base stickiness of 0 for simplicity, driven purely by OCI here
    # or one could add a base param. Here we focus on the OCI contribution.

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    # Track previous choice for stickiness
    last_action_1 = -1

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Temperature (Decision Noise)
This model proposes that high OCI is associated with reduced decision noise (higher beta), reflecting a more rigid or deterministic application of the learned values (whether correct or habitual). Alternatively, it could capture anxiety-driven randomness. Here we parameterize it so `beta` scales with OCI.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    is influenced by OCI. 
    
    effective_beta = beta_base * (1 + beta_oci_scale * oci)
    
    If beta_oci_scale is positive, high OCI makes behavior more deterministic (rigid).
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate.
    beta_base: [0, 10] - Baseline inverse temperature.
    beta_oci_scale: [0, 5] - Scaling factor for OCI's effect on beta.
