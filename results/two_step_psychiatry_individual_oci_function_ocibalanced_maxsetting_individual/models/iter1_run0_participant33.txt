Here are three cognitive models designed to explain the participant's behavior, incorporating the OCI score into different mechanisms of the reinforcement learning process.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Eligibility Trace
This model tests the hypothesis that OCI scores correlate with the strength of habit formation. In the hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free framework, the eligibility trace (`lambd`) controls how much the second-stage outcome reinforces the first-stage choice via the model-free system. A higher `lambd` implies that the agent credits the first-stage action more strongly for the final outcome, effectively chaining the decisions together into a habit. This model posits that higher OCI leads to a higher `lambd`.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    OCI-Modulated Eligibility Trace Model.
    
    Hypothesis: OCI score modulates the eligibility trace (lambda), affecting how strongly 
    the second-stage outcome reinforces the first-stage choice via the model-free system.
    High OCI might lead to stronger habit formation (higher lambda).
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0,1] General learning rate.
    - beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature (softness of choice).
    - w: [0,1] Mixing weight (1=MB, 0=MF).

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Inverse Temperature
This model tests the hypothesis that OCI scores influence the exploration-exploitation balance. Compulsive behavior is often characterized by rigidity. This model posits that higher OCI scores lead to a higher inverse temperature (`beta`), resulting in more deterministic choices and reduced exploration of alternative options.

    deterministic (rigid) choices and less random exploration.

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Negative Learning Rate
This model introduces separate learning rates for positive (rewarded) and negative (unrewarded) outcomes. It tests the hypothesis that individuals with higher OCI scores have a heightened sensitivity to negative outcomes (failure to receive a coin). The OCI score specifically modulates the learning rate for unrewarded trials (`lr_neg`), potentially causing more rapid devaluation of options that fail to pay out.

    rate for negative outcomes (failure), reflecting a heightened sensitivity to punishment.
