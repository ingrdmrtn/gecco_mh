Here are three cognitive models implemented as Python functions, following the specified template and constraints.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weight
This model tests the hypothesis that high obsessive-compulsive symptoms (high OCI) are associated with a deficit in goal-directed (Model-Based) control, leading to a reliance on habitual (Model-Free) control. The mixing weight parameter $w$ is dynamically adjusted based on the participant's OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid model where OCI modulates the balance between Model-Based and Model-Free control.
    Hypothesis: High OCI scores correlate with reduced Model-Based weighting (w).
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1]
    beta: [0, 10]
    w_base: [0, 1] - Baseline mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB) before OCI adjustment.
    w_oci_deficit: [0, 1] - Magnitude of reduction in Model-Based weight per unit of OCI.
    lambda_decay: [0, 1]
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_base, w_oci_deficit, lambda_decay = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]
    
    # Calculate OCI-adjusted weight: Higher OCI reduces w (more Model-Free)
    w = w_base - (w_oci_deficit * oci_score)
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        if action_1[trial] == -1:
            continue
            
        a1 = int(action_1[trial])

        q_net_stage1 = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net_stage1)

```

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Response Rigidity (Beta)
This model tests the hypothesis that high OCI scores are associated with behavioral rigidity or "determinism" in choice. The inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ is scaled by the OCI score, such that higher OCI leads to sharper probability distributions (higher $\beta$) and less exploration.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):

    beta_base: [0, 10] - Baseline inverse temperature.

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate (Inflexibility)
This model tests the hypothesis that high OCI scores are associated with cognitive inflexibility, represented as a reduced ability to update value estimates based on new information. The learning rate $\alpha$ is negatively modulated by the OCI score.
