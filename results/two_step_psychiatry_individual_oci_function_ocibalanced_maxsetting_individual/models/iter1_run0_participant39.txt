Here are three new cognitive models that explain the participant's behavior, incorporating their OCI score into different mechanisms of the two-step task (eligibility traces, learning rates, and model-based weighting).

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Eligibility Trace
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores alter the "eligibility trace" ($\lambda$). A higher eligibility trace implies that the second-stage outcome (reward/no-reward) reinforces the first-stage choice more directly, characteristic of a strong "habitual" formation where distal actions are reinforced by outcomes regardless of the intermediate state structure.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid model with OCI-modulated Eligibility Trace (Lambda).
    
    Hypothesis:
    Participants with high OCI scores may exhibit altered credit assignment 
    (eligibility traces), changing how strongly the Stage 2 outcome reinforces 
    the Stage 1 choice directly (Model-Free habit formation).
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate of value updating.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature (exploitation vs exploration).
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting between Model-Based and Model-Free values.
    stickiness: [-3, 3] - Bonus added to the previously chosen option.
    lambda_base: [-10, 10] - Base parameter for eligibility trace (pre-sigmoid).
    lambda_oci: [-10, 10] - Scaling of OCI on the eligibility trace.

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate
This model hypothesizes that OCI correlates with the rate of belief updating. High OCI might lead to cognitive rigidity (low learning rate) or hyper-sensitivity to recent outcomes (high learning rate). This model keeps stickiness fixed but allows the learning rate to vary with OCI.

    slower updating (rigidity) or faster updating (instability).

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weight (w) with Stickiness
This model revisits the hypothesis that OCI affects the balance between Goal-Directed (Model-Based) and Habitual (Model-Free) control. Unlike previous attempts, this model **includes a fixed stickiness parameter**, which is crucial for explaining the participant's repetitive behavior, while allowing OCI to specifically modulate the planning weight $w$.

    (habitual) systems. High OCI is expected to reduce w (less model-based).
