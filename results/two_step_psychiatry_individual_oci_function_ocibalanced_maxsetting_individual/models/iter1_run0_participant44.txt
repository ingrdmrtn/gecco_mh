Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the OCI score to explain the participant's decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Choice Stickiness (Perseveration)
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores are associated with "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous action regardless of reward history or model-based planning. This aligns with the compulsivity aspect of OCI, explaining the participant's long streaks of choosing the same spaceship.

    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with OCI-modulated Choice Perseveration (Stickiness).
    
    Hypothesis: Participants with high OCI scores exhibit 'stickiness', repeating 
    their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of value. The magnitude of this 
    stickiness is scaled by their OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Update rate for value estimation [0, 1]
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax [0, 10]
    - w: Mixing weight (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB) [0, 1]
    - lambd: Eligibility trace for Stage 2 outcomes affecting Stage 1 [0, 1]

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Learning Rigidity
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores correlate with cognitive rigidity, represented by a suppressed learning rate. A participant with high OCI updates their value estimates more slowly, making them resistant to changing their behavior even when rewards stop (explaining the perseverance without explicit stickiness parameters).

import numpy as np

    reduction in the learning rate. High OCI participants update their 
    beliefs more slowly, making them resistant to feedback.

    - lr_base: Baseline learning rate [0, 1]
    - lr_suppression: Factor by which OCI reduces learning rate [0, 1]

    # Calculate effective learning rate (Rigidity hypothesis)
    # As OCI increases, learning rate decreases.
    learning_rate = lr_base * (1.0 - (lr_suppression * oci_score))
    learning_rate = np.clip(learning_rate, 0.0, 1.0)

    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: OCI-Enhanced Habit Strength (Eligibility Trace)
This model posits that OCI affects the strength of the "eligibility trace" ($\lambda$). A higher eligibility trace means the outcome at Stage 2 (reward/no reward) directly reinforces the Stage 1 choice more strongly, bypassing the two-step structure. This represents a stronger formation of "habit chains" (Model-Free control) often associated with compulsive behavior.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with OCI-modulated Eligibility Trace.
    
    Hypothesis: High OCI scores strengthen the 'habit chain' between Stage 2 outcomes
    and Stage 1 choices. This is modeled by increasing the eligibility trace (lambda)
    as OCI increases, allowing direct reinforcement of the first choice by the 
    final reward (pure Model-Free characteristic).

    - learning_rate: Learning rate [0, 1]
    - beta: Inverse temperature [0, 10]
