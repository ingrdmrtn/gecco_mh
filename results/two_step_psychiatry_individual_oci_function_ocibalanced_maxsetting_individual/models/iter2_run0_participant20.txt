Here are three new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms by which Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI) scores might influence reinforcement learning in this task, specifically focusing on how habits (model-free) and goal-directed (model-based) systems interact.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weighting (Balance)
This model hypothesizes that higher OCI scores might be associated with a rigid reliance on habits (Model-Free) over goal-directed planning (Model-Based), or vice versa. Instead of a fixed mixing weight `w`, the weight is a function of the OCI score. Specifically, we model `w` as a logistic function of OCI to keep it bounded between 0 and 1, allowing the data to determine if high OCI leads to more MB or MF control.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with OCI-modulated Mixing Weight (w).
    
    Hypothesis: The balance between Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) control
    is not static but correlates with OCI symptoms. This model calculates the
    mixing weight 'w' dynamically based on OCI.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w_intercept: [0,10] - Base parameter for the logistic function determining w.
    w_slope: [0,10] - Slope parameter for how OCI affects w. If positive, high OCI -> more MB.
    
    The mixing weight w is calculated as:
    w = 1 / (1 + exp(-(w_intercept + w_slope * (oci - 0.5))))
    (Centered roughly on mid-range OCI).

    # We center OCI roughly around 0.5 for stability

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate Asymmetry
This model investigates if OCI symptoms relate to how participants process positive versus negative prediction errors. Compulsive behaviors are often linked to error-processing deficits. Here, we hypothesize that the learning rate is split into separate positive and negative rates, and the ratio or balance between them is skewed by the OCI score.

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Eligibility Trace (Lambda)
This model focuses on the "credit assignment" aspect of reinforcement learning. In the two-step task, the parameter $\lambda$ (eligibility trace) controls how much the second-stage reward reinforces the first-stage choice directly. A high $\lambda$ implies Model-Free agents connect the reward all the way back to the first choice. We hypothesize that OCI might correlate with "over-connection" or rigidity in credit assignment chains.

    High OCI might lead to stronger chaining of associations (higher lambda).

    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0,1] - Mixing weight.
