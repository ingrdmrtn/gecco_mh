Here are three new cognitive models based on the participant's high OCI score (0.93) and the provided data.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Inverse Temperature (Rigidity)
This model tests the hypothesis that high OCI scores are associated with increased decision rigidity (determinism). It posits that OCI modulates the inverse temperature (`beta`) parameter, making the participant's choices more sensitive to value differences (sticky to the best option) or less noisy as OCI increases.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid model where OCI modulates the inverse temperature (beta).
    Hypothesis: High OCI scores are associated with higher decision rigidity (higher beta),
    making choices more deterministic with respect to value differences.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight for Model-Based (1) vs Model-Free (0).
    - beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature.
    - beta_oci_slope: [0, 5] Increase in beta scaled by OCI score.

    learning_rate, w, beta_base, beta_oci_slope = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]
    
    # Calculate effective beta based on OCI
    # High OCI -> Higher Beta (More rigid/deterministic)
    beta = beta_base + beta_oci_slope * oci_score
    
    # Initialize values

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) + 0.5

```

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Learning Rate (Inflexibility)
This model proposes that OCI is linked to cognitive inflexibility, represented by a reduced learning rate. Instead of suppressing the Model-Based weight (as in previous attempts), this model suppresses the global learning rate, implying that high-OCI individuals are slower to update their internal value estimates in response to new information.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid model where OCI modulates the Learning Rate.

    lower effective learning rate.
    
    Parameters:
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - lr_max: [0, 1] Maximum learning rate (theoretical rate when OCI is 0).
    """
    beta, w, lr_max = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]

    # High OCI -> Lower Learning Rate (Inflexibility)
    # Ensure a tiny minimum learning rate to avoid stagnation

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Punishment Sensitivity
This model hypothesizes that high OCI individuals are hypersensitive to the absence of reward (0 coins), perceiving it as a punishment rather than a neutral outcome. This is modeled by introducing a negative reward value for 0-coin outcomes, with the magnitude scaled by the OCI score.
