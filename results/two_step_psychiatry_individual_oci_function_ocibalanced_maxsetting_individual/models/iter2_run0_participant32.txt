Here are 3 new cognitive models that incorporate the OCI score into the decision-making process in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid RL with OCI-modulated Model-Based Weight
This model assumes that individuals with high OCI scores might rely more heavily on a rigid, habit-like system (model-free) or conversely, might over-deliberate (model-based). Given the high OCI score (0.83) and the potential for compulsivity (habit) vs obsession (planning), this model tests the hypothesis that OCI modulates the balance between Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) control, specifically positing that high OCI might degrade the flexibility of MB control or enhance MF control.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid RL where OCI score modulates the mixing weight (w) between Model-Based and Model-Free values.

    w_intercept: [0,1]

    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_intercept, w_oci_slope = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]

    # Calculate mixing weight w based on OCI
    # w represents the weight of Model-Based values. 
    # High OCI might reduce MB reliance (negative slope) or increase it (positive slope).
    w = w_intercept + (w_oci_slope * oci_score)
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0) # Ensure w stays between 0 and 1

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2) # Model-free stage 1 values
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # Stage 2 values (same for MB and MF usually in simple hybrid models)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        a1 = int(action_1[trial])
        s_idx = int(state[trial])
        a2 = int(action_2[trial])
        r = reward[trial]

        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Model-Based Value Calculation

        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1) # Max value of next states
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Hybrid Value
        q_net = (w * q_stage1_mb) + ((1 - w) * q_stage1_mf)
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

        # Eligibility trace update (TD(1) logic) is often used for MF, 
        # but for simplicity and strict adherence to the template structure requested previously,
        # we stick to simple TD updates unless lambda is a parameter.

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))

```

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Choice Stickiness (Perseveration)
This model hypothesizes that OCI relates to "stickiness" or perseveration—the tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward. High OCI scores might correlate with higher behavioral rigidity (high stickiness). The stickiness parameter is a linear function of the OCI score.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free RL with Choice Stickiness modulated by OCI.

    stick_oci_slope: [-5, 5]

    learning_rate, beta, stick_intercept, stick_oci_slope = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]

    # Calculate stickiness parameter
    # Positive value means tendency to repeat; Negative means tendency to switch.
    stickiness = stick_intercept + (stick_oci_slope * oci_score)

    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1 = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    # Track previous choice for stickiness
    last_action_1 = -1

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        a1 = int(action_1[trial])
        s_idx = int(state[trial])
        a2 = int(action_2[trial])
        r = reward[trial]

        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Add stickiness bonus to Q-values before softmax

        if last_action_1 != -1:
            q_stage1_adjusted[last_action_1] += stickiness
            
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_stage1_adjusted)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

        # Update Stage 1
        # Using the value of the chosen stage 2 option to update stage 1
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2[s_idx, a2] - q_stage1[a1]
        q_stage1[a1] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Second-Stage Learning Rate (Separate Stage 2 Alpha)
This model suggests that OCI affects how quickly participants update their beliefs about the specific outcomes (the aliens/coins). Obsessive-compulsive traits might lead to "over-learning" from local prediction errors or, conversely, a rigidity that resists updating. Here, we separate the learning rate for the second stage ($\alpha_2$) and make it a function of OCI, while keeping a base learning rate for the first stage.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free RL with separate Stage 2 learning rate modulated by OCI.

    beta: [0,10]
    """

    # alpha_2 determines how fast they update alien probabilities
    alpha_2 = alpha_2_base + (alpha_2_oci_mod * oci_score)
    alpha_2 = np.clip(alpha_2, 0.001, 0.999)
