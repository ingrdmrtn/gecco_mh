Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the OCI score into the decision-making process using different mechanisms: memory decay, stage-specific rigidity, and decaying choice traces.

    Model-Free/Model-Based Hybrid with OCI-modulated Memory Decay.
    
    Hypothesis: Participants with higher OCI scores exhibit 'doubting' or memory 
    instability, represented by a decay (forgetting) of Q-values over time.
    The rate of forgetting is proportional to the OCI score. This forces the 
    agent to re-learn or rely more on immediate outcomes.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Value update rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature (randomness).
    w: [0, 1] - Weight for Model-Based control (0=MF, 1=MB).
    forgetting_sensitivity: [0, 1] - Scales how much OCI induces forgetting.

    posits that OCI increases the inverse temperature (beta) specifically for
