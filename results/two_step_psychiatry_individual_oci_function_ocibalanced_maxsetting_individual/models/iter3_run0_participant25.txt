Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for how Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI) scores might influence decision-making in this two-step task.

### Model 1: Hybrid Model with OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weight
This model assumes that the balance between Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habit) systems is influenced by OCI symptoms. Specifically, it tests the hypothesis that higher OCI scores might lead to either a rigid reliance on habits (lower `w`) or an over-deliberative planning style (higher `w`).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free learner where the mixing weight 'w' is 
    modulated by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for value estimation.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (softness of choice).
    - w_base: [0, 1] Baseline weight for model-based values.
    - oci_w_mod: [-1, 1] Modulation of 'w' by OCI score.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_base, oci_w_mod = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]
    
    # Calculate the mixing weight w based on OCI
    w = w_base + (oci_score * oci_w_mod)
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0) # Ensure w stays within [0, 1]

    # Fixed transition matrix for Model-Based calculation
    # Row 0: transitions from Space A -> [Planet X, Planet Y]
    # Row 1: transitions from Space B -> [Planet X, Planet Y]

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Q-values
    q_mf1 = np.zeros(2)       # Model-Free Stage 1 values
    q_mf2 = np.zeros((2, 2))  # Model-Free Stage 2 values (2 planets, 2 aliens)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # Bellman equation using known transitions and current max stage 2 values

        q_mb1 = transition_matrix @ max_q_mf2

        q_net = w * q_mb1 + (1 - w) * q_mf1

        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

        q_mf1[a1] += learning_rate * delta_1 
        # Note: Pure hybrid models often use TD(0) for MF stage 1 without eligibility traces 
        # to strictly separate MB and MF influence, though variants exist.

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Perseveration (Stickiness) Modulated by OCI
This model investigates if OCI scores relate to "stickiness" or perseveration—the tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward. This is often linked to compulsivity. The OCI score modulates how strong this repetition bias is.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    # Calculate effective stickiness
    stickiness = stick_base + (oci_score * oci_stick_mod)
    # No strict clipping to [0,1] needed as stickiness is an additive bias term, 
    # but let's keep it reasonable.

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1 = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    last_action_1 = -1 # Initialize with invalid action

    for trial in range(n_trials):

### Model 3: Asymmetric Learning Rates Modulated by OCI
This model posits that OCI symptoms might affect sensitivity to positive vs. negative prediction errors differently. For example, individuals with high compulsivity might over-learn from negative outcomes (avoidance) or fail to update properly after rewards. OCI here modulates the ratio or difference between positive (`alpha_pos`) and negative (`alpha_neg`) learning rates.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    prediction errors. The negative learning rate is modulated by OCI.

    - alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors (RPE > 0).
    - alpha_neg_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate for negative prediction errors (RPE < 0).
