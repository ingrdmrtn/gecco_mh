Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the OCI-R score to explain decision-making behavior in the two-step task.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Mixing Weight (Hybrid MB/MF)
This model hypothesizes that the balance between Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) control is influenced by obsessive-compulsive traits. Specifically, higher OCI scores might correlate with a stronger reliance on habitual (Model-Free) control or a deficit in goal-directed (Model-Based) planning.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: OCI-Modulated Mixing Weight.
    
    This is a Hybrid Model-Based / Model-Free Reinforcement Learning model.
    The mixing weight 'w' which balances the two systems is a linear function 
    of the participant's OCI score.
    
    w_net = w_base + (w_oci * oci_score)
    If w_net is close to 1, behavior is Model-Based.
    If w_net is close to 0, behavior is Model-Free.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (softness of choice).
    - w_base: [0, 1] Baseline mixing weight (intercept).
    - w_oci: [-1, 1] Slope of the OCI effect on the mixing weight.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_base, w_oci = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]
    
    # Calculate effective mixing weight bounded between 0 and 1
    w = w_base + (w_oci * oci_score)
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

### Model 2: OCI-Dependent Learning Rates (Separate Positive/Negative)
This model investigates if OCI symptoms affect how participants learn from positive versus negative outcomes differently. It proposes that the learning rate is split into a base rate and an OCI-modulated component, but crucially, this modulation might differ for rewards (learning from success) versus non-rewards (learning from failure).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 2: OCI-Dependent Dual Learning Rates.
    
    This model assumes pure Model-Free learning at Stage 1 (w=0 implicit) but 
    allows the learning rate to vary based on the OCI score.
    There is a base learning rate, and an OCI interaction term that 
    specifically amplifies or diminishes learning.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate.
    - lr_oci_scale: [-1, 1] How much OCI scales the learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - eligibility: [0, 1] Eligibility trace (how much Stage 2 outcome affects Stage 1).

### Model 3: OCI-Weighted Pruning (Heuristic Strategy)
This model tests a heuristic "pruning" strategy often observed in two-step tasks, where participants may ignore branches of the decision tree that have low value. Here, the extent to which a participant "prunes" (simplifies the decision) is modulated by their OCI score, hypothesizing that high OCI might lead to rigid over-pruning or inability to prune (considering all options anxiously).

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 3: OCI-Weighted Pruning / Inverse Pruning.
    
    This model implements a simplified strategy where the Stage 1 value 
    is heavily biased by the immediate maximum value available in Stage 2, 
    ignoring transition probabilities (a "max-max" heuristic).
    
    The degree to which they rely on this heuristic vs standard Model-Free 
    learning is determined by OCI.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
