Here are three new cognitive models. These models focus on different ways high OCI scores might influence reinforcement learning, specifically exploring mechanisms like **uncertainty aversion in model-based control**, **enhanced loss sensitivity (punishment learning)**, and **habitual rigidity (dampened eligibility traces)**.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weight
This model assumes that individuals with high OCI scores rely more heavily on habitual (model-free) control rather than flexible (model-based) planning, perhaps due to cognitive rigidity or distrust of internal models. The mixing parameter $w$ (where $w=1$ is pure Model-Based and $w=0$ is pure Model-Free) is down-weighted by the OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid reinforcement learning model where the balance between Model-Based (MB)
    and Model-Free (MF) control is modulated by the OCI score.
    Higher OCI scores reduce the weight of the Model-Based system (more habitual).

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w_base: [0,1] - Baseline weight for Model-Based control (0=MF, 1=MB).
    oci_w_penalty: [0,1] - Strength of reduction in MB weight due to OCI.

    # High OCI reduces w, shifting behavior towards Model-Free
    w = w_base * (1.0 - (oci_score * oci_w_penalty))
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)

    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Dual Learning Rates (Positive/Negative) with OCI-Enhanced Punishment Sensitivity
This model hypothesizes that high OCI is associated with an over-sensitivity to negative outcomes (missing a reward). The model splits the learning rate into $\alpha_{pos}$ and $\alpha_{neg}$, and the OCI score specifically boosts the learning rate for negative prediction errors (when reward is 0), making the agent abandon unrewarded options more quickly.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    alpha_neg_base: [0,1] - Base learning rate for negative prediction errors (Reward = 0).
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.

    # High OCI -> Higher learning rate for failures (hypersensitivity to mistakes)

### Model 3: Eligibility Trace (Lambda) Learner with OCI-Driven Decay
This model uses a TD($\lambda$) approach. The parameter $\lambda$ controls how much credit is assigned to the first-stage choice based on the second-stage outcome. Here, OCI modulates $\lambda$. A high OCI might be associated with difficulty linking distal outcomes to initial choices (low $\lambda$), or conversely, "over-thinking" and linking everything (high $\lambda$). Given the previous success of stickiness (perseveration), this model tests if OCI affects the *decay* of the eligibility trace, potentially making the agent treat the two steps as more disconnected (lower lambda) or more connected.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
