Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the OCI score into the decision-making process in different ways, specifically focusing on the balance between model-based and model-free control, and how high OCI might distort learning or value estimation.

### Model 1: Hybrid RL with OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weight (`w`)
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores are associated with a deficit in Model-Based (goal-directed) control, leading to a reliance on Model-Free (habitual) control. The mixing parameter `w` (0 = purely model-free, 1 = purely model-based) is dynamically calculated based on the participant's OCI score. A base `w` is modified by an OCI sensitivity parameter, allowing the model to capture if high OCI reduces the influence of the transition structure on choices.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid RL with OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weight (w).
    
    This model combines Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) reinforcement learning.
    The mixing weight 'w' determines the balance between MB and MF values for the first-stage choice.
    Here, 'w' is derived from a base level and an OCI-dependent modulation.
    Hypothesis: High OCI reduces Model-Based control (lowers w).

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (softmax sensitivity).
    - w_base: [0, 1] Base weight for Model-Based control (before OCI adjustment).
    - w_oci_slope: [0, 1] Strength of OCI's negative impact on 'w'.

### Model 2: Asymmetric Learning Rates based on OCI (Safety/Compulsion Bias)
This model posits that individuals with high OCI might display asymmetric learning from positive versus negative prediction errors. Specifically, compulsive behavior might be driven by a fear of negative outcomes or an over-emphasis on avoiding loss (or missing out), or conversely, a rigid updating style. Here, the OCI score modulates the ratio between learning from positive prediction errors (`alpha_pos`) and negative prediction errors (`alpha_neg`).

import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free RL with OCI-modulated Asymmetric Learning Rates.
    
    This model splits the learning rate into alpha_pos (for RPE > 0) and alpha_neg (for RPE < 0).
    The OCI score shifts the balance. High OCI might sensitize the learner to negative outcomes
    (avoidance learning) or positive outcomes (habit formation).
    
    alpha_neg = alpha_base * (1 + OCI * sensitivity)
    alpha_pos = alpha_base

    Parameters:
    - alpha_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - neg_learning_sensitivity: [0, 5] How much OCI amplifies learning from negative RPEs.

    n_trials = len(action_1)
    participant_oci = oci[0]

    # Define learning rates
    alpha_pos = alpha_base
    # If sensitivity is high, high OCI makes alpha_neg larger than alpha_pos
    alpha_neg = alpha_base * (1.0 + participant_oci * neg_learning_sensitivity)
    # Clip to ensure stability
    alpha_neg = np.clip(alpha_neg, 0.0, 1.0)

### Model 3: OCI-Driven Exploration Suppression (Inverse Temperature Modulation)
This model investigates if OCI affects the exploration-exploitation trade-off. High OCI is often linked to rigidity and intolerance of uncertainty. This could manifest as an extremely high inverse temperature (`beta`), meaning the participant exploits small value differences deterministically and rarely explores. Instead of a fixed beta, beta is a function of the OCI score.

import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    Hypothesis: High OCI leads to reduced exploration (higher beta/inverse temperature).
    The effective beta is calculated as: beta_effective = beta_min + (beta_scale * OCI).
    This forces the model to be more deterministic (rigid) as OCI increases.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta_min: [0, 10] Minimum inverse temperature (baseline exploration).
