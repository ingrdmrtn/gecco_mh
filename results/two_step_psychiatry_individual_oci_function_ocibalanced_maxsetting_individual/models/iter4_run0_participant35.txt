Here are three new cognitive models that explore mechanisms of obsessive-compulsive behavior beyond simple stickiness, focusing on eligibility traces, transition learning, and stress-induced control deficits.

    Hybrid Model with OCI-Modulated Eligibility Trace (Lambda).
    
    Hypothesis: High OCI individuals exhibit 'hyper-habitual' learning where Stage 1 choices 
    are directly reinforced by the outcome (Reward), bypassing the Model-Free chain 
    (Stage 2 value). This is modeled by the eligibility trace parameter lambda. 
    High OCI is hypothesized to increase lambda, strengthening direct S1-Outcome associations.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (softmax sensitivity).
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting between Model-Based (1) and Model-Free (0).
    - stickiness: [0, 5] General perseveration bonus for repeated Stage 1 choices.
