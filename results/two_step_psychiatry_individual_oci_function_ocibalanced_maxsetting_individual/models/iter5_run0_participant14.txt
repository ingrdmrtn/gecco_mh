Here are three cognitive models that incorporate the OCI score into the decision-making process in distinct, theoretically grounded ways.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Eligibility Trace
This model hypothesizes that OCI scores affect the "credit assignment" process—specifically, how strongly the outcome at the second stage (getting a coin or not) reinforces the choice made at the first stage. A higher eligibility trace implies a stronger habitual link between the final reward and the initial spaceship choice, bypassing the model-based structure.

    OCI-Modulated Eligibility Trace Model.
    
    Hypothesis: Obsessive-compulsive traits affect how 'deeply' a participant links 
    the final outcome back to the initial choice (credit assignment).

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Loss Aversion with Stickiness
This model combines the successful "stickiness" parameter from previous iterations with a mechanism for "Loss Aversion" modulated by OCI. It hypothesizes that individuals with higher OCI scores might react more strongly to the absence of a reward (0 coins), effectively treating it as a larger negative prediction error, while also maintaining a baseline tendency to repeat choices.

    Hypothesis: High OCI contributes to an over-sensitivity to 'failure' (0 coins).

    by the OCI score. This is combined with a standard stickiness parameter.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1]
    - beta: [0, 10]
    - w: [0, 1]

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Win-Stay Stickiness
The previous best model used general stickiness modulated by OCI. This model refines that hypothesis: it proposes that OCI-related perseveration is not just repetition, but specifically a "Win-Stay" compulsion. The tendency to repeat a choice is split into a baseline stickiness and an OCI-dependent component that only activates after a reward (coin) was received.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    OCI-Modulated Win-Stay Stickiness.
    
    Hypothesis: OCI modulates stickiness specifically in the context of positive 
    reinforcement (Win-Stay). The participant has a baseline tendency to repeat,
    but the OCI score scales an additional urge to repeat specifically when the 
    previous trial was rewarded.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1]
    - beta: [0, 10]
    - w: [0, 1]
    - stick_base: [0, 5] Baseline tendency to repeat regardless of outcome.
