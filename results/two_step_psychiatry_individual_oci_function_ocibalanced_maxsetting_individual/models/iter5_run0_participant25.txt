Here are three cognitive models based on the participant's data and OCI scores.

### Model 1: Hybrid MB/MF with OCI-Modulated Stickiness
This model posits that the participant uses a mixture of Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) strategies. The key individual difference is in "choice stickiness" (perseveration), where the tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice regardless of reward is modulated by their OCI score. This builds on the previous best model (MF + Stickiness) by adding the Model-Based component which is essential for this two-step task.

import numpy as np

    """

    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB).

### Model 2: Hybrid MB/MF with OCI-Modulated Inverse Temperature
This model hypothesizes that OCI symptoms relate to the randomness or determinism of decision-making (exploration/exploitation balance). Here, the OCI score modulates the `beta` (inverse temperature) parameter. A higher OCI might lead to more rigid, deterministic choices (higher beta) or more anxious, erratic responding (lower beta), applied within a Hybrid MB/MF framework.

import numpy as np

### Model 3: Hybrid MB/MF with OCI-Modulated Learning Rate
This model proposes that the rate at which value expectations are updated is a function of OCI severity. High OCI might be associated with "over-learning" from recent events (high learning rate) or rigidity/slow updating (low learning rate). The OCI score scales the learning rate linearly (clipped to [0,1]).
