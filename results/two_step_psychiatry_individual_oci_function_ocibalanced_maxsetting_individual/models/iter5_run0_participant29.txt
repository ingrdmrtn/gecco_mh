Here are 3 new cognitive models that introduce different mechanisms for how OCI scores might modulate learning and decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weighting with Asymmetric Learning
This model tests the hypothesis that OCI symptoms affect the balance between model-based (goal-directed) and model-free (habitual) control (`w`), but specifically couples this with separate learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors. High OCI might be associated with a stronger reliance on habits (lower `w`) and a heightened sensitivity to negative outcomes (punishment).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weighting with Asymmetric Learning.

    This model posits that OCI affects the balance between model-based and model-free 
    systems (w), while also allowing for asymmetric learning rates for positive and 
    negative prediction errors.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    - lr_neg_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate for negative prediction errors.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (softmax sensitivity).
    - w_base: [0, 1] Base mixing weight for model-based system (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - w_oci_mod: [0, 1] Modulation of w by OCI score.

    # Hypothesis: Higher OCI leads to more habitual behavior (lower w).
    # We constrain w to be between 0 and 1.
    w = w_base - (w_oci_mod * oci_score)
    w = min(1.0, max(0.0, w))
    
    # We use the base negative learning rate directly (could also modulate this, 
    # but keeping params <= 5 means we focus on w modulation here while allowing asymmetry).

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Choice Perseverance (Sticky Choice)
This model investigates if OCI symptoms relate to "stickiness" or choice perseverance—the tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward. High OCI (compulsivity) might manifest as a higher tendency to repeat actions (perseveration).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):

    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (MB vs MF).

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Second-Stage Update Sensitivity (Lambda)
This model introduces an eligibility trace parameter (`lambda`) that is modulated by OCI. This parameter controls how much the second-stage reward prediction error updates the first-stage model-free values. A high `lambda` means the first stage is strongly updated by the final outcome (direct reinforcement), while a low `lambda` relies more on the temporal difference at the transition. This mechanism explores if OCI affects how credit is assigned across the two stages.
