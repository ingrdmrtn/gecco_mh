Here are three new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms for how OCI symptoms might influence decision-making in the two-step task, specifically focusing on mixing model-based/model-free strategies and altering learning rates or exploration.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Mixing Weight (Hybrid Learner)
This model assumes the participant uses a hybrid of Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) reinforcement learning. The key hypothesis here is that the balance between these two systems ($w$) is modulated by the OCI score. A higher OCI score might lead to a more rigid, habit-based (MF) strategy, or conversely, a more deliberative (MB) strategy. This model tests if the "weight" parameter $w$ is a linear function of OCI.

    """
    Model 1: OCI-Modulated Mixing Weight (Hybrid Learner).
    
    This model implements a hybrid reinforcement learning agent that combines 
    Model-Free (MF) and Model-Based (MB) values. The mixing weight 'w' determines
    the relative contribution of MB vs MF systems (w=1 is pure MB, w=0 is pure MF).
    Here, 'w' is dynamically determined by the participant's OCI score.
    
    Hypothesis: OCI traits influence the reliance on goal-directed (MB) vs habitual (MF) systems.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (softmax sensitivity).
    - w_intercept: [0, 1] Baseline mixing weight for an OCI score of 0.
    - w_slope: [-1, 1] How much the mixing weight changes per unit of OCI.
    - lambda_eligibility: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay (connects stage 2 to stage 1).

### Model 2: OCI-Dependent Learning Rate Asymmetry (Pos/Neg Bias)
This model posits that OCI symptoms affect how participants learn from positive versus negative outcomes differently. Specifically, it tests if higher OCI leads to a stronger reaction to negative outcomes (or lack of reward) compared to positive ones. The learning rate is split into `lr_pos` and `lr_neg`, where `lr_neg` is modulated by the OCI score. This reflects the clinical intuition that obsessive-compulsive traits may involve hyper-sensitivity to errors or missed rewards.

### Model 3: OCI-Driven Inverse Temperature (Exploration/Exploitation)
This model investigates the relationship between OCI and the exploration-exploitation trade-off. It posits that the inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ (which controls choice randomness) is a function of the OCI score. A high OCI might lead to higher $\beta$ (more deterministic/rigid choices, less exploration) or lower $\beta$ (more anxiety-driven randomness). It uses a pure Model-Based framework for the update logic to contrast with the Model-Free approaches, testing if the *decision noise* rather than the *learning process* is the key variant.
