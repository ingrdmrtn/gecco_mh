Here are three cognitive models expressed as Python functions. They incorporate the OCI-R score to explain individual variability in the two-step task.

    Hybrid model with OCI-modulated Outcome Stickiness (Planet Stickiness).
    
    Hypothesis: High OCI individuals exhibit 'Outcome Stickiness'—a desire to return 
    to the previously visited state (Planet), distinct from simply repeating the previous 
    motor action. This biases the Stage 1 choice towards the spaceship most likely to 
    lead to the previous planet, regardless of whether the previous transition was rare or common.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0,1] Value updating rate.
    - beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature (softness of choice).
    - w: [0,1] Weighting parameter (0=Model-Free, 1=Model-Based).
