Here are three new cognitive models for the two-step task, incorporating the OCI score to explain individual variability in decision-making.

### Model 1: Epsilon-Greedy Exploration Modulated by OCI
This model hypothesizes that OCI symptoms relate to "checking" behaviors or uncertainty, modeled as a higher rate of random exploration (epsilon) that overrides value-based choices.

    Hypothesis: Participants with higher OCI scores exhibit higher 'checking' behavior,
    manifesting as a higher rate of random choices (epsilon) regardless of learned values.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax (value sensitivity).
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control (1=MB, 0=MF).

### Model 2: Choice Kernel (Habit) Modulated by OCI
This model distinguishes between simple one-step "stickiness" and a longer-term "habit" (Choice Kernel). It hypothesizes that OCI modulates the strength of this habit formation, where choices are repeated based on their frequency history, independent of reward.

### Model 3: Counterfactual Updating Modulated by OCI

    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Direct learning rate for chosen option.
