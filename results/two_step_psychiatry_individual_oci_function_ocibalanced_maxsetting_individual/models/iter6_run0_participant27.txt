Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task and the participant's OCI score. These models explore different mechanisms of how obsessive-compulsive traits might influence reinforcement learning, specifically focusing on perseveration, model-based control balance, and learning rate modulation.

### Model 1: Hybrid RL with OCI-Driven Perseveration (Sticky Choice)
This model hypothesizes that OCI symptoms manifest as "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat previous choices regardless of reward outcome. The degree of this stickiness is modulated by the OCI score. It uses a hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free architecture where the mixing weight `w` is fixed, but the choice stickiness is variable.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid RL with OCI-modulated choice stickiness (perseveration).
    
    Hypothesis: Higher OCI scores lead to higher choice perseveration (stickiness),
    making it harder to switch away from previous actions regardless of outcomes.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (0=Model-Free, 1=Model-Based).
    - stick_base: [0, 5] Base level of choice stickiness.
    - stick_oci_mod: [-5, 5] Modulation of stickiness by OCI score.

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Trade-off with Decay
This model posits that OCI affects the balance between Model-Based (goal-directed) and Model-Free (habitual) control. Specifically, high OCI might be associated with a stronger reliance on rigid habitual (Model-Free) systems or, conversely, an over-reliance on Model-Based planning. The mixing weight `w` is a logistic function of the OCI score. Additionally, it includes a decay parameter for unchosen options, reflecting memory constraints.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w_intercept: [-5, 5] Base log-odds of using Model-Based control.

### Model 3: Separate Learning Rates for Wins and Losses Modulated by OCI
This model explores the idea that OCI is related to altered sensitivity to punishment (losses/omissions) versus reward. It implements a simple Model-Free system (often sufficient if the participant is very habitual) but splits the learning rate into `alpha_win` and `alpha_loss`. The `alpha_loss` is specifically modulated by the OCI score, testing the hypothesis that OCI increases learning from negative outcomes.

    """

    (learning from losses/omissions), while reward learning remains baseline.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr_win: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive rewards (1.0).
    - lr_loss_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate for zero rewards (0.0).
    - lr_loss_oci_slope: [-1, 1] OCI modulation of loss learning rate.
