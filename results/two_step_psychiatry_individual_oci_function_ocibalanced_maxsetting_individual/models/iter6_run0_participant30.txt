Here are 3 new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms for how OCI symptoms might influence decision-making in this two-step task, specifically focusing on perseveration, model-based/model-free arbitration, and learning rates.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores lead to increased "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward. This reflects the repetitive nature of compulsive behaviors. The `stickiness` parameter is added to the Q-values of the previously chosen action, and this effect is modulated by the OCI score.

### Model 2: OCI-Balanced Max Setting
This model investigates if OCI affects how participants arbitrate between Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) control specifically through the `w` parameter. Instead of a linear modulation, it uses a sigmoid-like balance where `w` is determined by a base level and an OCI-dependent shift. This captures the hypothesis that high OCI might rigidly lock a participant into a specific strategy (e.g., purely habitual/MF or over-deliberative/MB).

    systems. The parameter w is derived directly from OCI using a scaled logistic 
    function to ensure it stays within [0, 1], allowing the model to find if 
    high OCI correlates with extreme MB or MF usage.

### Model 3: OCI-Driven Asymmetric Learning Rates
This model tests the hypothesis that OCI affects how participants learn from positive versus negative prediction errors. Individuals with high OCI might be hyper-sensitive to errors (negative feedback) or, conversely, overly driven by rewards. The model splits the learning rate into `alpha_pos` and `alpha_neg`, where the balance between them is modulated by the OCI score.

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
