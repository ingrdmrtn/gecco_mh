Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the OCI-R score into the decision-making process for the two-step task.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Balance
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores are associated with a rigid reliance on habitual (Model-Free) control, making it harder to engage in flexible, goal-directed (Model-Based) planning. The parameter `w` (mixing weight) is dynamically adjusted based on the OCI score. Specifically, higher OCI reduces the contribution of the model-based system.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: OCI-Modulated MB/MF Balance.
    Hypothesis: High OCI participants exhibit reduced model-based control (goal-directed behavior)
    and increased reliance on model-free (habitual) control. The mixing weight 'w' is 
    down-regulated by the OCI score.
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0, 1]
    beta: [0, 10]
    w_max: [0, 1] (Maximum possible model-based weight)

    n_trials = len(action_1)
    oci_score = oci[0]

    # Calculate effective w based on OCI
    # Higher OCI reduces w, pushing behavior towards Model-Free
    w = w_max * (1.0 - (oci_score * oci_suppression))
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)

```

### Model 2: OCI-Enhanced Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model posits that OCI is linked to behavioral rigidity or "stickiness"—a tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward outcome. Here, the OCI score scales a stickiness parameter that biases the Stage 1 choice towards the previously chosen spaceship.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    scaled by the OCI score.

### Model 3: OCI-Dependent Learning Rate Asymmetry
This model suggests that individuals with high OCI might learn differently from positive versus negative prediction errors. Specifically, high OCI might lead to "hyper-learning" from negative outcomes (punishment sensitivity) or rigid value updating. Here, we split the learning rate into positive (`alpha_pos`) and negative (`alpha_neg`) components, where the negative learning rate is amplified by the OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 3: OCI-Dependent Learning Rate Asymmetry.
    Hypothesis: High OCI is associated with altered sensitivity to prediction errors.

    prediction errors (alpha_neg) is scaled up by the OCI score, reflecting increased
    sensitivity to worse-than-expected outcomes.

    alpha_pos: [0, 1] (Learning rate for positive RPEs)
