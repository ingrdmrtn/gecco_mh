Here are three cognitive models implemented as Python functions, designed to explain the participant's behavior in the two-step task, incorporating their OCI score to modulate specific cognitive processes.

### Cognitive Model 1: OCI-Modulated Win-Stay Stickiness
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores correlate with "reinforcement stickiness"—a strong compulsion to repeat actions that were immediately successful. Unlike general perseveration, this stickiness is only triggered by positive outcomes (wins), reflecting a specific sensitivity to success or safety signals in obsessive-compulsive traits.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    OCI-Modulated Win-Stay Stickiness Model.
    
    Hypothesis: High OCI participants exhibit enhanced stickiness specifically after receiving a reward 
    (reinforcement amplification), leading to repetitive choices driven by success. Losses do not 
    trigger this specific sticky bonus, distinguishing it from general perseveration.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight of Model-Based system (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - win_stick_oci: [0, 5] Stickiness bonus applied only after a win, scaled by OCI.

        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        # Calculate stickiness: Applied ONLY if the previous trial resulted in a win (reward=1)
        # The magnitude is proportional to the participant's OCI score.
        stickiness = np.zeros(2)
        if last_action_1 != -1 and last_reward == 1.0:
            stickiness[int(last_action_1)] = win_stick_oci * oci_score
            
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * (q_net + stickiness))
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[int(action_1[trial])]

    return log_loss
```

### Cognitive Model 2: OCI-Modulated Risk-Averse Planning
This model suggests that high OCI is associated with pessimism or risk aversion. When the Model-Based system plans ahead (calculating the value of reaching Planet X or Y), it does not simply assume the best possible outcome (max Q). Instead, it mixes in the worst possible outcome (min Q) proportional to the OCI score, effectively devaluing uncertain states.

    evaluates future states (Planets), it mixes the maximum Q-value (optimistic) with the 
    minimum Q-value (pessimistic) proportional to the OCI score.

### Cognitive Model 3: OCI-Modulated Tunnel Vision (Unchosen Decay)
This model posits that high OCI participants suffer from "tunnel vision" or hyper-focus. While they update the value of the chosen action normally, the values of *unchosen* actions decay (return to zero) more rapidly than in low OCI participants. This represents a difficulty in maintaining working memory for alternative paths.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    Hypothesis: High OCI participants focus narrowly on their chosen path. The values of unchosen actions
    (both spaceships and aliens) decay (are forgotten) faster than for low OCI participants.
    This creates a "tunnel vision" effect where alternative options become less relevant over time.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for chosen options.
