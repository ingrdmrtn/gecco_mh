Here are three cognitive models designed to explain the participant's behavior, specifically incorporating the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI) score to modulate decision-making mechanisms.

### Model 1: Asymmetric Learning Rates (Anxious Update)
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores are associated with an asymmetric sensitivity to prediction errors. Specifically, individuals with high obsessive-compulsive traits may over-react to outcomes that are worse than expected (negative prediction errors) due to error-signaling hypersensitivity, while processing positive outcomes normally.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with OCI-modulated Asymmetric Learning Rates.
    
    Hypothesis:
    High OCI participants have a heightened learning rate for negative prediction errors 
    (outcomes worse than expected), reflecting a 'fear of failure' or hyper-correction 
    mechanism, while positive updates remain at the baseline rate.

    Parameters:
    lr_base: [0,1] - Baseline learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
    w: [0,1] - Weighting between Model-Based (1) and Model-Free (0).
    lambda_elig: [0,1] - Eligibility trace decay.
    oci_neg_boost: [0,5] - Multiplier for the learning rate when prediction error is negative, scaled by OCI.

### Model 2: Dynamic Transition Learning
This model assumes that while the standard Model-Based agent uses a fixed transition matrix (0.7/0.3), a high OCI participant might constantly re-evaluate the transition structure of the world. High OCI is linked to uncertainty intolerance; this model posits that such individuals attempt to "learn" the transition probabilities more aggressively (or differently) rather than relying on the instructions, potentially leading to fluctuating Model-Based values.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with OCI-modulated Transition Learning.
    
    Hypothesis:
    The participant does not assume a fixed 70/30 transition structure. Instead, they 
    learn the transition matrix from experience. The rate at which they update their 
    belief about spaceship reliability is modulated by their OCI score (reflecting 
    hyper-vigilance or checking behavior).

    lr_val: [0,1] - Learning rate for value updates (Q-learning).
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated "Win-Stay" Bias
Previous models explored general stickiness (repetition regardless of outcome). This model proposes that OCI specifically exacerbates "Win-Stay" behavior. High OCI individuals may view a successful outcome as a rigid rule ("I must do exactly what I did last time to prevent harm"), creating a strong bias to repeat the previous successful Stage 1 choice, distinct from standard value-based reinforcement.

    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with OCI-modulated Win-Stay Bias.
    
    Hypothesis:
    High OCI scores drive a specific heuristic compulsion: 'Win-Stay'. 
    If the previous trial was rewarded, the participant receives an additional 
    bonus to the utility of the previously chosen spaceship, independent of 
    the actual Q-values. This reflects a ritualistic repetition of successful actions.

    learning_rate: [0,1] - Value updating rate.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
