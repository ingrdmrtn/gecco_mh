Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for how Obsessive-Compulsive symptoms (OCI) might influence decision-making in this two-step task, specifically focusing on perseveration, model-based control, and learning rates.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores lead to increased "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward. This reflects the compulsive aspect of OCD, where behaviors are repeated rigidly. The model incorporates a stickiness parameter that is boosted by the participant's OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with OCI-modulated choice stickiness (perseveration).
    
    Hypothesis: Participants with higher OCI scores exhibit higher 'stickiness' 
    (tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice), reflecting compulsive repetition.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Value update rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting between Model-Based (1) and Model-Free (0) systems.
    - stick_base: [0, 5] Baseline tendency to repeat the previous choice.
    - stick_oci_sens: [0, 5] Additional stickiness per unit of OCI.

    stickiness = stick_base + (participant_oci * stick_oci_sens)

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    prev_action_1 = -1 # No previous action for the first trial

    for trial in range(n_trials):

    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weight (Decreasing)
This model posits that high OCI scores are associated with a *deficit* in goal-directed (model-based) control, leading to a greater reliance on habitual (model-free) systems. Instead of a fixed weight `w`, the weight is dynamically determined by a base parameter and an OCI-dependent penalty.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    planning, favoring habitual (Model-Free) control.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Value update rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w_base: [0, 1] Baseline weight for Model-Based control (for OCI=0).

### Model 3: OCI-Asymmetric Learning Rates (Punishment Sensitivity)
This model suggests that OCI relates to altered sensitivity to negative outcomes (or lack of reward). It uses separate learning rates for positive (reward=1) and negative (reward=0) outcomes. The hypothesis is that high OCI might be associated with "hyper-learning" from failure (or safety checking), so the negative learning rate is modulated by OCI.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Free Q-learning with separate learning rates for positive/negative outcomes,
    where OCI modulates the learning rate for negative outcomes (losses).
    
    Hypothesis: High OCI participants are hypersensitive to errors/losses, 
    learning more rapidly from non-rewarded trials.
    
    Parameters:
    - alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for rewarded trials.
    - alpha_neg_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate for unrewarded trials.
    - alpha_neg_oci_sens: [0, 1] Increase in negative learning rate per unit of OCI.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - lambda_eligibility: [0, 1] Eligibility trace decay (connects stage 2 to stage 1).
