Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the OCI score into the decision-making process in different ways, specifically targeting mechanisms relevant to obsessive-compulsive traits like habit formation, sensitivity to rare events, and uncertainty avoidance.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Eligibility Traces (Habit Formation)
This model hypothesizes that individuals with higher OCI scores have stronger "habitual" learning traces. Instead of just a simple Model-Free update, this model implements an eligibility trace ($\lambda$) for the first-stage values based on the second-stage outcome. The decay rate of this trace is modulated by the OCI score, suggesting that higher OCI leads to longer-lasting credit assignment to the initial choice, reinforcing habits.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid learner with OCI-modulated eligibility traces.
    
    This model assumes that OCI affects the eligibility trace decay (lambda).
    Higher OCI leads to a higher lambda, meaning the first-stage action is 
    more strongly reinforced by the second-stage reward (habit formation).
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate for value updates.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting between model-based and model-free values (0=MF, 1=MB).
    lambda_base: [0, 1] - Base eligibility trace decay parameter.
    oci_lambda_boost: [0, 1] - How much OCI increases the eligibility trace.

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Transition Re-evaluation (Rare Transition Sensitivity)
This model proposes that individuals with higher OCI scores are more sensitive to "prediction errors" in the transition structure itself. While the standard model assumes a fixed transition matrix (0.7/0.3), this model assumes the participant might doubt this structure when rare transitions occur. The OCI score modulates a "surprise penalty" applied to the Model-Based values when a rare transition occurred in the *previous* trial, reflecting a hesitation or re-evaluation common in anxiety/OCD phenotypes.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    penalty to the Model-Based system's valuation in the current trial.
    The magnitude of this penalty is determined by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] - MB/MF mixing weight.

### Model 3: OCI-Based Exploration Suppression (Inverse Temperature Modulation)
High OCI often correlates with rigidity and a lack of exploration. This model posits that OCI doesn't change the learning mechanism (values), but rather the *choice policy* specifically. It suggests that higher OCI leads to a higher `beta` (inverse temperature), making the policy more deterministic (exploiting the current best option) and suppressing random exploration.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Standard Hybrid Model where OCI modulates the exploration parameter (beta).
    
    This model assumes that OCI is directly related to behavioral rigidity.
    Instead of a fixed beta, the effective beta is boosted by the OCI score,
    making high-OCI participants more deterministic and less likely to explore.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate.
    beta_base: [0, 10] - Baseline inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] - MB/MF mixing weight.
    oci_rigidity_scale: [0, 5] - Scaling factor for OCI's effect on beta.
    stickiness: [0, 5] - General choice perseveration (independent of OCI).
