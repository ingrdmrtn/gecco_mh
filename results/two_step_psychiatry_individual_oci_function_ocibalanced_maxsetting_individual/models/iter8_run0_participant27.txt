Here are the three proposed cognitive models.

### Cognitive Model 1: OCI-Modulated Stage 1 Temperature
This model hypothesizes that OCI symptoms specifically affect the exploration/exploitation balance (inverse temperature $\beta$) during the first stage of the decision-making process. High OCI might lead to either more rigid (high $\beta$) or more chaotic (low $\beta$) choices at the spaceship selection stage, potentially due to anxiety about the probabilistic transitions, while the second stage (alien choice) remains independent.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model where OCI modulates the inverse temperature (beta) 
    specifically for the first-stage choice.
    
    Hypothesis: OCI scores relate to decision noise or rigidity in the 
    high-uncertainty first stage (spaceship choice), separate from the 
    second stage (alien choice).
    
    Parameters:
    lr: [0,1] - Learning rate for value updates.
    beta1_base: [0,10] - Base inverse temperature for Stage 1.
    beta1_oci_coeff: [-5,5] - Coefficient scaling OCI effect on beta1.
    beta2: [0,10] - Inverse temperature for Stage 2.
    w: [0,1] - Mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB).
    stickiness: [0,5] - Choice perseveration bonus.

### Cognitive Model 2: Asymmetric Learning with OCI-Modulated MB Weight
This model incorporates Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory by allowing different learning rates for positive outcomes (rewards) and negative/neutral outcomes (no reward). Additionally, the OCI score modulates the weight $w$ placed on model-based control, testing if OCI symptoms shift the balance between goal-directed and habitual systems.

    1. Participants learn differently from gains vs losses (Asymmetric LR).
    2. OCI symptoms shift the reliance on Model-Based planning (w).

### Cognitive Model 3: OCI-Modulated Eligibility Trace
This model proposes that OCI symptoms affect the strength of the eligibility trace ($\lambda$). A higher $\lambda$ implies stronger habit formation by linking the final reward directly to the initial spaceship choice, effectively "caching" the outcome. OCI might correlate with a tendency to form these long-range habitual associations.

```python

    """

    Hypothesis: OCI scores relate to the strength of the 'habitual link' 
    between the Stage 2 outcome and the Stage 1 choice. High lambda implies 
    stronger direct reinforcement of the first choice based on the final reward.
    
    Parameters:
    lr: [0,1] - Learning rate.
    beta: [0,10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0,1] - Mixing weight.
