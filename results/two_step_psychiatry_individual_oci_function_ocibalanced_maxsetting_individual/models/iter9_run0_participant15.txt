Here are three new cognitive models based on the participant's data and OCI score.

### Cognitive Model 1: OCI-Modulated Rare Transition Penalty
**Hypothesis**: High OCI symptoms are associated with an overactive error/conflict monitoring system. When the participant experiences a "rare" transition (e.g., choosing Spaceship A but ending up at Planet Y), this generates a conflict signal that acts as an implicit punishment, regardless of the actual reward outcome. This model subtracts a penalty from the stored value of the chosen spaceship whenever a rare transition occurs.
**Parameters**:
- `lr`: Learning rate for value updates.
- `beta`: Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
- `w`: Model-based weight.
- `stick`: Basic choice stickiness.
- `rare_pen_oci`: Magnitude of the value penalty applied after a rare transition, scaled by OCI.

    Model 1: OCI-Modulated Rare Transition Penalty.

### Cognitive Model 2: OCI-Modulated Cumulative Habit Strength
**Hypothesis**: OCI involves repetitive behaviors that become entrenched over time. Instead of simple "win-stay" or lag-1 stickiness, this model implements a "Habit Trace" that accumulates when an action is repeated and decays slowly. The *influence* (weight) of this accumulated habit on the current decision is modulated by the OCI score.
**Parameters**:
- `lr`: Learning rate.
- `beta`: Inverse temperature.
- `w`: Model-based weight.
- `habit_decay`: The rate at which the habit trace decays (persistence of the habit).
- `habit_w_oci`: The weight of the habit trace in the decision process, scaled by OCI.

### Cognitive Model 3: OCI-Modulated Stage 2 Precision
**Hypothesis**: OCI patients may exhibit different levels of exploration/exploitation trade-offs specifically at the second stage (the concrete task of choosing aliens), distinct from the abstract first stage. This model proposes that OCI modulates the inverse temperature (`beta`) specifically for the second stage, reflecting either rigid exploitation (high beta) or anxious uncertainty (low beta) at the terminal decision point.
**Parameters**:
- `lr`: Learning rate.
- `beta_stage1`: Inverse temperature for the spaceship choice.
- `beta_stage2_oci`: Inverse temperature for the alien choice, scaled by OCI.
- `w`: Model-based weight.
- `stick`: Basic choice stickiness for Stage 1.
