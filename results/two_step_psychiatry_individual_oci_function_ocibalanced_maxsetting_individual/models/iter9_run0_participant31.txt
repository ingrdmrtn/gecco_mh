Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the OCI score into the decision-making process in novel ways, based on the provided template and feedback.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weighting
This model hypothesizes that individuals with higher OCI scores might rely more (or less) on the Model-Based (planning) system versus the Model-Free (habit) system. High compulsivity is often associated with habit formation (Model-Free), so we test if the weighting parameter `w` is a function of OCI.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weighting.
    
    This model assumes a hybrid Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) reinforcement learning agent.
    The mixing weight 'w' between MB and MF values is modulated by the participant's OCI score.
    w = w_base + w_oci_slope * oci
    w is then clamped between 0 and 1.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate for MF value updates.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax action selection.
    w_base: [0, 1] - Baseline MB weight intercept.
    w_oci_slope: [-1, 1] - Slope of MB weight with respect to OCI.

    current_oci = oci[0]
    
    # Calculate w based on OCI and clamp it
    w = w_base + (w_oci_slope * current_oci)
    if w < 0: w = 0
    if w > 1: w = 1

### Model 2: OCI-Dependent Learning Rate Asymmetry
This model investigates if OCI scores affect how participants learn from positive versus negative prediction errors. It proposes that higher OCI might lead to a different learning rate for "disappointment" (negative prediction error) compared to "success" (positive prediction error), potentially reflecting a hypersensitivity to failure or perfectionism.

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):

    This model splits the learning rate into positive (alpha_pos) and negative (alpha_neg) components.
    The negative learning rate is modulated by OCI, testing if high OCI leads to 
    over-updating from negative outcomes (or under-updating).
    
    alpha_neg = alpha_neg_base + alpha_oci_slope * oci

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Eligibility Trace (Lambda)
This model introduces an eligibility trace parameter ($\lambda$) that controls how much credit is assigned to the first-stage choice based on the second-stage outcome. It hypothesizes that OCI affects this credit assignment—perhaps high OCI individuals have a stronger "memory" or link between distal outcomes and initial choices, or conversely, they might struggle to link them.

    Lambda is modulated by the OCI score.
