Here are the 3 proposed cognitive models.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Transition Belief Distortion
This model hypothesizes that high OCI scores are associated with a distorted belief about the stability of the environment. While the true transition probabilities are fixed (0.7/0.3), participants with high OCI may perceive these transitions as more deterministic (rigid belief, $\gamma > 1$) or more uniform (uncertainty/mistrust, $\gamma < 1$). This distortion specifically affects the Model-Based (MB) value calculation, representing a cognitive bias in planning.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    OCI-Modulated Transition Belief Distortion.
    
    Hypothesis: OCI modulates the perceived transition matrix used in Model-Based planning.
    The true probabilities P are distorted by an exponent gamma: P_perceived ~ P^gamma.
    High OCI might lead to 'rigid' beliefs (gamma > 1) or 'blurred' beliefs (gamma < 1),
    affecting how Stage 2 values are projected back to Stage 1.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr: [0,1] Learning rate for Model-Free Q-values.
    - beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature (choice consistency).
    - w: [0,1] Weight for Model-Based control (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - lambd: [0,1] Eligibility trace (credit assignment from Stage 2 reward to Stage 1 choice).
    - dist_base: [0,5] Baseline distortion exponent (1.0 = accurate belief).
    - dist_oci: [-5,5] Modulation of distortion by OCI score.

### Model 2: OCI-Modulated Subjective Loss Aversion
This model posits that for participants with higher OCI scores, the absence of a reward (0 coins) is not neutral but actively aversive. This "Subjective Loss" transforms the reward function such that 0 outcomes are treated as negative values. This increases the contrast between winning and losing and affects the learned Q-values (and thus the MB planning values) differently than simply scaling the inverse temperature.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    OCI-Modulated Subjective Loss Aversion.
    
    Hypothesis: High OCI participants treat the '0 coins' outcome as a punishment (negative reward)
    rather than a neutral zero. This 'loss magnitude' is modulated by OCI.
    This affects both the learning trajectory (driving Q-values negative) and the Model-Based 
    expectations.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr: [0,1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0,1] Model-Based weight.

    # Calculate subjective loss magnitude
    loss_mag = loss_base + loss_oci * oci_score
    # Ensure loss magnitude is effectively non-negative (so outcome is <= 0)
    # If parameter optimization drives it negative, we clip to 0.

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Transition-Dependent Stickiness
This model investigates whether OCI modulates "stickiness" (perseveration) differentially based on whether the previous outcome was a *Common* or *Rare* transition. High OCI might lead to rigid repetition even after "unlucky" (Rare) transitions, whereas low OCI participants might interpret a Rare transition as a signal to switch or re-evaluate. This separates stickiness into a "Common-Transition" component and an OCI-modulated "Rare-Transition" component.

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    OCI-Modulated Transition-Dependent Stickiness.
    
    Hypothesis: Perseveration (stickiness) depends on whether the previous trial's 
    transition was Common or Rare. High OCI may cause participants to 'stick' to their 
    choice even after a Rare transition (rigidity), whereas typical behavior might 
    show less stickiness or switching after rare outcomes.
