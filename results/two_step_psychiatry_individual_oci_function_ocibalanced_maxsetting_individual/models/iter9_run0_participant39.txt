Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the participant's OCI score to explain their decision-making in the two-step task. These models focus on different potential mechanisms of compulsion: altered model-based control, punishment sensitivity, and perseveration.

### Model 1: OCI-Modulated Model-Based Weighting
This model tests the hypothesis that high OCI scores are associated with a deficit in goal-directed (Model-Based) control, leading to a stronger reliance on habitual (Model-Free) systems. It models the weighting parameter `w` as a function of the OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model where the balance (w) is modulated by OCI.
    
    Hypothesis: Higher OCI scores lead to reduced Model-Based control (lower w),
    reflecting a reliance on habitual/compulsive responding over goal-directed planning.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (softness of choice).
    - w_base: [0, 1] Base weight for Model-Based control (intercept).
    - w_oci_slope: [0, 1] Reduction in MB weight per unit of OCI.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_base, w_oci_slope = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    participant_oci = oci[0]

    # Calculate w based on OCI, clamping it between 0 and 1
    w = w_base - (participant_oci * w_oci_slope)
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)
    
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[int(action_1[trial])]

        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---
        s_idx = int(state[trial])
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[s_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[int(action_2[trial])]

        # --- Learning ---
        a1 = int(action_1[trial])
        a2 = int(action_2[trial])
        r = reward[trial]
        
        # MF Update Stage 2
        delta_stage2 = r - q_stage2_mf[s_idx, a2]
        q_stage2_mf[s_idx, a2] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # MF Update Stage 1
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[s_idx, a2] - q_stage1_mf[a1]
        q_stage1_mf[a1] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: OCI-Driven Asymmetric Learning Rates
This model hypothesizes that high OCI is linked to an over-sensitivity to negative outcomes (or lack of reward). Instead of a single learning rate, it uses separate rates for positive and negative prediction errors, with the negative learning rate being amplified by the OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Model with separate learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors,
    where the negative learning rate is modulated by OCI.

    Hypothesis: High OCI individuals are hyper-sensitive to negative feedback 
    (or absence of reward), learning more rapidly from disappointments.

    Parameters:
    - alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors (RPE > 0).
    - alpha_neg_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate for negative prediction errors (RPE < 0).
    - alpha_neg_oci_boost: [0, 1] Increase in negative learning rate scale by OCI.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Model-Based weight.

    alpha_pos, alpha_neg_base, alpha_neg_oci_boost, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    participant_oci = oci[0]

    # Calculate effective negative learning rate
    alpha_neg = alpha_neg_base + (participant_oci * alpha_neg_oci_boost)
    alpha_neg = np.clip(alpha_neg, 0.0, 1.0)

### Model 3: OCI-Modulated Choice Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model investigates whether high OCI manifests as "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward. The stickiness parameter is directly scaled by the OCI score.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with choice stickiness (perseveration) modulated by OCI.

    leading to a higher probability of repeating the previous Stage 1 action 
    regardless of outcome.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Value learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Model-Based weight.
    - stick_base: [0, 5] Base stickiness parameter.
