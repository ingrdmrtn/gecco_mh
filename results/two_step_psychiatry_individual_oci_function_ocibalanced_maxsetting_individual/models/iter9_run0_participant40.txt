Here are three cognitive models expressed as Python functions.

### Model 1: Habitual Rigidity (Dynamic Beta)
**Hypothesis:** High OCI participants exhibit "locking in" behavior. As they repeat a choice, they become increasingly rigid and deterministic, ignoring contradictory evidence.
**Mechanism:** The inverse temperature (`beta`) is not static. It increases (stiffens) based on a "Habit Trace" that tracks consecutive choices. OCI modulates the gain of this stiffness. A high OCI participant becomes hyper-exploitative (high beta) once a habit is formed.

```python
import numpy as np

    """
    Habitual Rigidity Model (Dynamic Beta).
    
    Hypothesis: OCI modulates the relationship between habit strength and decision noise.
    As a participant repeats an action, the inverse temperature (beta) increases,
    making the choice more deterministic (rigid).
    
    Parameters:
    - lr: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature.
    - beta_stiff_oci: [0, 10] OCI-dependent increase in beta per unit of habit trace.
    - w: [0, 1] Model-based weight.
    - stickiness: [0, 5] Basic choice stickiness bonus.
    - trace_decay: [0, 1] Decay rate of the habit trace.
    - lambda_eligibility: [0, 1] Eligibility trace parameter.

### Model 2: Surprise-Gated Model-Based Control
**Hypothesis:** High OCI participants are intolerant of uncertainty/surprise. When they encounter a "Rare" transition (a violation of their internal model), they lose confidence in the Model-Based system and retreat to Model-Free (habitual) control for the subsequent trial.
**Mechanism:** The Model-Based weight `w` is dynamic. If trial `t-1` was a rare transition, `w` for trial `t` is dampened by an OCI-dependent factor.

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):

### Model 3: Compulsive Maintenance (Defensive Stage 1 Updating)
**Hypothesis:** High OCI participants are resistant to devaluing their top-level choices (Spaceships) based on downstream failures. They exhibit a specific deficit in propagating negative prediction errors from Stage 2 back to Stage 1. This "defensive" updating preserves the value of the chosen spaceship even when it yields no coins, leading to the observed "100 trials of 0" perseveration.
**Mechanism:** The learning rate for the Stage 1 TD-error (`delta_stage1`) is asymmetric. If `delta_stage1` is negative (Stage 2 value < Stage 1 value), the update is dampened by OCI.

import numpy as np
