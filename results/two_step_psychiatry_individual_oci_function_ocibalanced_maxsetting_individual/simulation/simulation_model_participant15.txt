    Simulates choices and rewards using Model 2: OCI-Modulated Win-Stay Stickiness.
    
    This model hypothesizes that OCI symptoms increase the tendency to compulsively 
    repeat a successful action ("Win-Stay"). Stickiness is not constant but is 
    boosted by OCI specifically when the previous trial was rewarded.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [lr, beta, w, stick_base, stick_win_oci]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float or list/array): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
