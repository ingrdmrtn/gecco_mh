Here is the simulation code corresponding to the provided model fitting function.

```python
import numpy as np

rng = np.random.default_rng()

def simulate_model(
    n_trials,
    parameters,
    drift1,
    drift2,
    drift3,
    drift4,
    oci=None):
    """
    Simulates choices and rewards using a Model-Free Learner with OCI-Dependent Choice Perseveration.
    
    The 'stickiness' parameter adds a bonus to the previously chosen action, 
    making repetition more likely. This bonus is scaled by the OCI score.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [lr, beta, stickiness_base, stickiness_oci]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float or None): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score for the participant.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
