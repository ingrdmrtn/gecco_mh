```python

    Simulates Model 3: OCI-Modulated Choice Stickiness.
    
    This model adds a 'stickiness' bonus to the Q-values of the previously chosen action.
    The magnitude of this stickiness is determined by the OCI score.
    
    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, w, stick_base, stick_oci_slope]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float or None): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score. If None, assumes 0 or handles appropriately.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
