Here is the simulation code corresponding to the provided model fitting function.

```python
import numpy as np

rng = np.random.default_rng()

def simulate_model(
    n_trials,
    parameters,
    drift1,
    drift2,
    drift3,
    drift4,
    oci=None):
    """
    Simulates choices and rewards using the Model-Free RL with OCI-Driven Win-Stay Amplification.
    
    Logic:
    - Pure Model-Free RL (no Model-Based component, no eligibility traces).
    - Stage 1 choice is influenced by Q-values and a stickiness bonus.
    - Stickiness has a base component and an additional boost if the previous trial was rewarded.
    - The magnitude of the 'win-stay' boost is scaled by the participant's OCI score.
    - Stage 2 choice is standard softmax on Q-values.
    
    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, stickiness_base, oci_winstay_boost]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float or None): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score (scalar).

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
