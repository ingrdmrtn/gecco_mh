Here is the simulation code corresponding to the provided model fitting function.

```python
import numpy as np

    n_trials,
    parameters,
    drift1,

    drift3,
    drift4,
    oci=None):
    """
    Simulates choices and rewards using the Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free RL model
    where the mixing weight is modulated by the OCI score.

    Hypothesis: High OCI participants rely more on Model-Free (habitual) control.
    The mixing weight 'w' (0=MF, 1=MB) is scaled down by the OCI score.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, w_base]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float or None): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score for the participant.
                             If None, defaults to 0.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
