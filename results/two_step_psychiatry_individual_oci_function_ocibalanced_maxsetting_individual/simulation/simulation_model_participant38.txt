Here is the simulation code corresponding to the `cognitive_model3` fitting function provided.

```python
import numpy as np

def simulate_model(
    n_trials,
    parameters,
    drift1,
    drift2,
    drift3,
    drift4,
    oci=None):
    """
    Simulates choices and rewards using the Hybrid MB/MF learner with OCI-modulated Stage 1 Rigidity.
    
    The key feature of this model is that the inverse temperature (beta) for the first-stage choice
    is scaled by the OCI score, representing 'planning rigidity', while the second-stage beta
    remains at a baseline level.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta_base, w, rigidity_factor]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float or None): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score for the participant.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
