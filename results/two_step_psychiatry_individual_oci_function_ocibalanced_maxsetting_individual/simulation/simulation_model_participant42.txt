Here is the simulation code corresponding to the `cognitive_model3` fitting function provided.

```python
import numpy as np

    n_trials,
    parameters,
    drift1,
    drift2,
    drift3,
    drift4,
    oci=None):
    """
    Simulates choices and rewards using Model 3: OCI-Modulated Win-Stay Heuristic Bias.
    
    This model simulates a standard hybrid MB/MF agent but adds a specific bias term
    to the first-stage decision values. If the previous trial was rewarded, the value 
    of the previously chosen action is boosted proportional to the participant's OCI score.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta, w, ws_strength]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities for the four terminal states.
        oci (float or None): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score. If None, defaults to 0.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1, corresponding to indices 0 and 1 in transition matrix).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
