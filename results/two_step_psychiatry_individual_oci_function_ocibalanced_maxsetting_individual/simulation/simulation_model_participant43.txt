Here is the simulation code corresponding to the `cognitive_model1` fitting function provided.

```python
import numpy as np

def simulate_model(
    n_trials,
    parameters,
    drift1,
    drift2,
    drift3,
    drift4,
    oci=None):
    """
    Simulates choices and rewards using the OCI-Modulated Counterfactual Regret Model.
    
    Hypothesis: High OCI participants engage in counterfactual updating. 
    When an outcome is observed, they also update the unchosen option in Stage 2. 
    Specifically, if Reward=0, they assume the unchosen option would have had Reward=1, 
    driven by a 'regret' parameter scaled by OCI.
    
    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [lr, beta, w, stickiness, oci_regret]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float or list or np.ndarray): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score for the participant.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
