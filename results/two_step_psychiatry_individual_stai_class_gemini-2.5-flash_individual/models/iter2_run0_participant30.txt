Here are three new cognitive models, each proposing a distinct cognitive strategy influenced by anxiety (STAI score) to explain the participant's decision-making in the two-step task.

```python
import numpy as np

class ParticipantModel1(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: Anxiety reduces the overall learning rate.
    High anxiety leads to a reduced learning rate (alpha), making participants
    update their value estimates more slowly across both stages. This could
    reflect a cautious approach to learning in an uncertain environment,
    where new information is integrated more slowly.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha_base: [0, 1] - Base learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    stai_alpha_reduction_factor: [0, 1] - How much STAI score reduces alpha.
                                          A higher value means higher anxiety leads to a lower alpha.
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha_base, self.beta, self.stai_alpha_reduction_factor = model_parameters

    def init_model(self) -> None:
        """
        Initialize the effective learning rate based on base alpha and STAI score.
        """
        # Calculate effective alpha, ensuring it stays within reasonable bounds [0.01, 1.0]
        # and doesn't become negative.
        self.alpha = np.clip(self.alpha_base * (1 - self.stai * self.stai_alpha_reduction_factor), 0.01, 1.0)
        # The base class value_update method will use this self.alpha

cognitive_model1 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel1)


class ParticipantModel2(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: Anxiety drives avoidance of previously unrewarding second-stage options.
    High anxiety leads participants to be more likely to avoid an alien
    that previously yielded no reward, specifically in the same planet.
    This is a direct policy bias at stage 2, reflecting a heightened
    aversion to repeating negative outcomes.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    avoidance_bonus_base: [0, 5] - Base negative bias applied to the Q-value of the last unrewarding alien.
    stai_avoidance_impact: [0, 5] - How much STAI score increases this avoidance bonus.

    def policy_stage2(self, state: int) -> np.ndarray:
        """
        Compute stage-2 action probabilities, applying an anxiety-modulated
        negative bias to the Q-value of the last chosen alien if it yielded no reward
        in the current planet.
        """
        q_biased = np.copy(self.q_stage2[state])
        
        # Apply avoidance bonus only if the previous trial resulted in 0 reward
        # and the current state (planet) is the same as the last state.
        if self.last_reward == 0 and self.last_state == state and self.last_action2 is not None:

    # The default value_update method (TD learning) is used, as the avoidance
    # only affects action selection at stage 2.

cognitive_model2 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel2)


class ParticipantModel3(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: Anxiety induces a pessimistic value bias during inter-stage value propagation.
    High anxiety leads to a pessimistic bias in value estimation, particularly when
    integrating expected future rewards (from Stage 2) into the first-stage Q-values.
    This means the value propagated back from the second stage is discounted further
    if the participant is anxious, reflecting a "catastrophizing" tendency.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1] - Learning rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
