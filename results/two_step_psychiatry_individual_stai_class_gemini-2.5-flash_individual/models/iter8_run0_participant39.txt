Here are three new cognitive models, each proposing a different hypothesis about how the highly anxious participant (STAI score 0.6625) makes decisions in the two-step task, and how their anxiety modulates their behavior.

### ParticipantModel2: Anxiety-modulated Reward Sensitivity

This model proposes that high anxiety reduces the subjective value of received rewards (gain sensitivity). Anxious individuals might perceive positive outcomes as less impactful, leading to slower or less robust learning from successful trials. This could explain why the participant might stick to a seemingly "safe" option even if rewards are only moderate, or why they might be slow to adapt to changes.

```python
class ParticipantModel2(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: High anxiety reduces the subjective value of received rewards (gain sensitivity).
    This model proposes that the actual reward received is scaled down before being used in the value update process.
    This scaling factor is modulated by the participant's STAI score, with higher anxiety leading to a greater
    reduction in perceived reward value, reflecting a diminished capacity to appreciate positive outcomes.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1] - Learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Softmax inverse temperature.
    reward_sensitivity_base: [0, 2] - Baseline factor by which rewards are scaled. Default 1.0 means no scaling.
    stai_reward_reduction_factor: [0, 1] - Factor by which STAI reduces the reward sensitivity.
                                           A higher value means more anxious individuals perceive rewards as less valuable.
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.reward_sensitivity_base, self.stai_reward_reduction_factor = model_parameters

    def value_update(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        # Calculate effective reward sensitivity based on STAI score
        # Ensure the sensitivity factor is positive and within reasonable bounds.
        # A higher STAI leads to a lower effective sensitivity.
        effective_reward_sensitivity = self.reward_sensitivity_base - (self.stai_reward_reduction_factor * self.stai)
        effective_reward_sensitivity = np.clip(effective_reward_sensitivity, 0.01, 2.0) 

        # Scale the reward before using it in the update
        scaled_reward = reward * effective_reward_sensitivity

        # Stage 2 value update using scaled reward
        delta_2 = scaled_reward - self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        self.q_stage2[state, action_2] += self.alpha * delta_2
        
        # Stage 1 value update
        delta_1 = self.q_stage2[state, action_2] - self.q_stage1[action_1]
        self.q_stage1[action_1] += self.alpha * delta_1

cognitive_model2 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel2)
```

### ParticipantModel3: Anxiety-modulated Q-value Decay

This model hypothesizes that high anxiety leads to increased cognitive load or impaired memory, causing learned Q-values to decay faster over time. This makes the participant more reliant on recent experiences, as older value estimates fade more quickly. This could explain why a particularly strong recent event (like the -1.0 reward on trial 5) might have a disproportionate, but potentially short-lived, impact if not reinforced.

```python
class ParticipantModel3(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: High anxiety increases the decay rate of learned Q-values, reflecting impaired memory or increased cognitive load.
    This model introduces a decay mechanism where Q-values for all actions gradually revert towards a neutral baseline
    (e.g., 0.0 for rewards centered around zero) after each trial. This decay rate is amplified
    by the participant's STAI score, suggesting that anxious individuals rely more heavily on recent experiences
    because older memories of value fade faster.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1] - Learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Softmax inverse temperature.
    decay_rate_base: [0, 0.5] - Baseline decay rate for Q-values per trial.
    stai_decay_boost_factor: [0, 1] - Factor by which STAI amplifies the decay rate.
                                      A higher value means more anxious individuals experience faster value decay.
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.decay_rate_base, self.stai_decay_boost_factor = model_parameters

    def post_trial(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        # Call base class post_trial to save last_action, state, reward
        super().post_trial(action_1, state, action_2, reward)

        # Calculate effective decay rate based on STAI score
        # Ensure decay rate is non-negative and capped to prevent values from flipping signs too quickly.
        effective_decay_rate = self.decay_rate_base + (self.stai_decay_boost_factor * self.stai)
        effective_decay_rate = np.clip(effective_decay_rate, 0, 0.5) 

        # Assuming rewards are centered around 0 (-1, 0, 1), decay towards 0.0.
        baseline_q = 0.0 

        # Apply decay to all Q-values for stage 1
        self.q_stage1 = self.q_stage1 * (1 - effective_decay_rate) + baseline_q * effective_decay_rate
        
        # Apply decay to all Q-values for stage 2
        self.q_stage2 = self.q_stage2 * (1 - effective_decay_rate) + baseline_q * effective_decay_rate

### ParticipantModel4: Anxiety-modulated State Aversion after Negative Outcome

This model proposes that high anxiety leads to a persistent aversion towards specific states (planets) where negative rewards have been experienced. Upon encountering a negative outcome in a particular planet, that planet becomes "marked" as aversive, and a negative bias is applied to all actions within that state. The strength of this aversion is amplified by the participant's STAI score, explaining why anxious individuals might strongly avoid environments associated with past negative experiences. This could explain the prolonged avoidance of options leading to planet 1.0 after the -1.0 reward on trial 5.

```python
class ParticipantModel4(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: High anxiety leads to a persistent aversion towards states (planets) where negative rewards have been experienced.
    This model introduces a mechanism where, upon receiving a negative reward, the associated state (planet)
    becomes 'marked' as aversive. A fixed negative bias is then applied to the Q-values of all actions
    within that state. The magnitude of this aversion is amplified by the participant's STAI score,
    reflecting a stronger avoidance of previously 'bad' environments for anxious individuals.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1] - Learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Softmax inverse temperature.
    aversion_strength_base: [0, 5] - Baseline strength of the negative bias applied to aversive states.
    stai_aversion_amplification: [0, 5] - Factor by which STAI amplifies the state aversion strength.
                                           A higher value means more anxious individuals develop stronger aversions.
