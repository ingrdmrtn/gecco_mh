To convert the model fitting code into model simulation code, we need a function that orchestrates the decision-making process trial-by-trial, using the cognitive model's policies and updating its internal states (Q-values, `last_action1`, `last_reward`). The provided example `simulate_model` function already serves as an excellent template for this purpose, being generic enough to work with any `CognitiveModelBase` subclass, including `ParticipantModel3`.

The key steps in the simulation function are:
1.  **Initialization**: Set up the random number generator and instantiate the cognitive model with the given parameters. Initialize arrays to store the simulated actions, states, and rewards.
2.  **Trial Loop**: Iterate for `n_trials`.
    *   **Stage 1 Decision**: Call `model.policy_stage1()` to get action probabilities and then sample `action_1` based on these probabilities.
    *   **Transition**: Use the model's transition probabilities (`model.T`) based on `action_1` to determine the next `state`.
    *   **Stage 2 Decision**: Call `model.policy_stage2(state)` to get action probabilities for the current state and sample `action_2`.
    *   **Reward Generation**: Determine the reward probability based on the given `drift` arrays for the current state and `action_2`, then randomly sample a binary reward (0 or 1).
    *   **Learning and Bookkeeping**: Call `model.value_update()` to update Q-values and `model.post_trial()` to store the latest action, state, and reward, which are crucial for the `stay-switch` logic in `ParticipantModel3` for the next trial.
    *   **Record Data**: Store the simulated `action_1`, `state`, `action_2`, and `reward` for the current trial.
3.  **Return**: After all trials, return the collected arrays.

Here is the `simulate_model` function, incorporating the necessary `numpy` import and adhering to the specified input/output parameters.
