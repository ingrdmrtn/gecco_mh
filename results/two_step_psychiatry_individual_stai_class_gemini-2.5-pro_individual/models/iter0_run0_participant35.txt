As a cognitive scientist and Python programmer, I will propose three distinct models to explain this participant's decision-making process. Given the participant's high STAI score (0.725), these models will focus on prominent theories linking anxiety to alterations in learning and decision-making, such as reduced goal-directed control, increased behavioral rigidity, and heightened sensitivity to negative feedback. The participant's behavioral data, characterized by a strong initial preference for one option despite mixed outcomes, suggests that habitual or heuristic strategies may be dominating their choices.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Hybrid Control
This model tests the hypothesis that anxiety impairs the balance between goal-directed (model-based) and habitual (model-free) decision-making. A purely model-based agent would use its knowledge of the task structure (i.e., which spaceship commonly goes to which planet) to make optimal choices. This model proposes that this participant, due to high anxiety, underweights this model-based information and relies more heavily on simpler, stimulus-response learning. The model-based weight `w` is scaled by `(1 - stai)`, directly linking higher anxiety to reduced reliance on planning.

```python
class ParticipantModel1(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: This model proposes that high anxiety impairs model-based control.
    The participant's choices are a hybrid of model-free (habitual) and model-based
    (goal-directed) valuation. The weight given to the model-based system is
    inversely proportional to the participant's STAI score, reflecting a shift
    towards more habitual behavior under anxiety. This could explain why the
    participant persists with an action even when a rare transition leads to a
    reward, an outcome that should devalue the action for a model-based agent.

        state_values = np.max(self.q_stage2, axis=1)

        # Combine model-free (self.q_stage1) and model-based values
        q_hybrid = w * q_model_based + (1 - w) * self.q_stage1

        return self.softmax(q_hybrid, self.beta)

cognitive_model1 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel1)
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Perseveration
This model explores a simpler, heuristic-based explanation: anxiety promotes cognitive inflexibility and behavioral rigidity. It hypothesizes that the participant has a tendency to repeat their previous choice, a phenomenon known as perseveration. The strength of this "sticky" choice bias is directly proportional to the participant's STAI score. This model provides a direct mechanism to explain the long sequences of repeated choices for spaceship 0 seen in the data, framing it as an anxiety-driven inability to flexibly switch strategies.

```python
class ParticipantModel2(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: This model suggests that high anxiety leads to increased
    perseveration or "stickiness" in choice behavior. The participant has a
    tendency to repeat their previous first-stage action, and this tendency
    is amplified by their anxiety level. This provides a simple, heuristic-based
    explanation for the observed behavior of making long sequences of the same
    choice, reflecting cognitive inflexibility that can be associated with anxiety.

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.pi = model_parameters

    def policy_stage1(self) -> np.ndarray:
        """

        perseveration bonus to the previously chosen action.

        # Start with standard model-free Q-values
        q_final = np.copy(self.q_stage1)

        # On all but the first trial, add a perseveration bonus
        if self.last_action1 is not None:
            # Anxiety modulation: higher STAI increases the perseveration bonus
            perseveration_bonus = self.pi * self.stai
            q_final[self.last_action1] += perseveration_bonus

        return self.softmax(q_final, self.beta)

cognitive_model2 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel2)
```

### Model 3: Anxiety-Modulated Asymmetric Learning
This model shifts the focus from choice mechanisms to the underlying learning process. The hypothesis is that anxiety induces a pessimistic learning bias, making the participant more sensitive to negative outcomes than positive ones. The model implements two distinct learning rates: one for positive prediction errors (better-than-expected outcomes) and another for negative prediction errors (worse-than-expected outcomes). The learning rate for negative errors is increased as a function of the STAI score, meaning that non-rewarded trials have a disproportionately large impact on the participant's future decisions.

```python
class ParticipantModel3(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: This model posits that high anxiety alters the learning process itself,
    specifically by making the participant more sensitive to negative outcomes.
    The model uses separate learning rates for positive and negative prediction
    errors. The learning rate for negative errors (e.g., receiving no reward when
    one was expected) is increased as a function of the participant's STAI score.
    This reflects a "pessimistic" learning bias, where bad outcomes have a greater
    impact on value updating than good outcomes.

    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]      (Base learning rate)

        self.alpha, self.beta, self.neg_bias = model_parameters

    def init_model(self) -> None:

        self.alpha_pos = self.alpha
        # The learning rate for negative outcomes is the base rate plus a bonus
