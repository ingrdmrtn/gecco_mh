As a cognitive scientist and Python programmer, I've analyzed this participant's data. The most salient feature is the complete lack of exploration at the first stage: the participant chose spaceship 0 on every single trial. This extreme perseveration, coupled with a high anxiety score (stai=0.75), suggests that their decision-making is heavily influenced by anxiety-related cognitive patterns, such as inflexibility, uncertainty avoidance, or habituation.

The models I propose below test three distinct hypotheses for how high anxiety could lead to this rigid behavior.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Driven Perseveration
This model hypothesizes that high anxiety creates a strong, explicit bias to repeat previous actions, a phenomenon known as perseveration or choice stickiness. The participant is not necessarily failing to learn; rather, their choice policy is overwhelmed by a powerful drive to stick with what they did last time, reducing the cognitive load and uncertainty of making a new choice. The strength of this perseverative bias is directly scaled by the participant's anxiety level.

```python
class ParticipantModel1(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: High anxiety (`stai`) enhances a tendency to repeat the previous 
    first-stage choice. This is modeled as a 'stickiness' bonus (`kappa`) added to the 
    value of the previously chosen action, with the bonus magnitude scaled by the 
    participant's stai score. This captures how anxiety can lead to behavioral rigidity.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]     (Learning rate)
    beta:  [0, 10]    (Inverse temperature for softmax)
    kappa: [0, 5]     (Perseveration bonus strength)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.kappa = model_parameters

    def policy_stage1(self) -> np.ndarray:
        """Computes stage-1 action probabilities with an anxiety-scaled perseveration bonus."""
        q_values_perseveration = self.q_stage1.copy()
        
        # Add a bonus to the value of the last chosen action
        if self.trial > 0 and self.last_action1 is not None:
            # The perseveration bonus is scaled by the anxiety score
            perseveration_bonus = self.kappa * self.stai
            q_values_perseveration[self.last_action1] += perseveration_bonus
            
        return self.softmax(q_values_perseveration, self.beta)

cognitive_model1 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel1)
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Blunted First-Stage Learning
This model posits that anxiety impairs the ability to learn from the outcomes of the initial, more abstract choice. The participant might find the task's two-step structure cognitively demanding, and high anxiety could lead them to disengage from learning about the first-stage options. This is modeled as a learning rate for the first-stage values (`q_stage1`) that is negatively modulated by anxiety. Learning about the immediate, second-stage choices remains intact, explaining why their alien choices vary.

```python
class ParticipantModel2(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: High anxiety (`stai`) selectively impairs learning about the value 
    of the initial, more complex stage-1 choices. The stage-1 learning rate is 
    suppressed as a function of `stai`, while stage-2 learning remains unaffected. 
    This leads to 'fossilization' of initial stage-1 preferences.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]     (Base learning rate)
    beta:  [0, 10]    (Inverse temperature for softmax)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta = model_parameters

    def value_update(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        """Update values with an anxiety-modulated learning rate for stage 1."""
        # Stage-2 learning is unaffected by anxiety
        delta_2 = reward - self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        self.q_stage2[state, action_2] += self.alpha * delta_2
        
        # Stage-1 learning rate is suppressed by high anxiety
        alpha_stage1 = self.alpha * (1 - self.stai)
        
        # Update stage-1 value using the suppressed learning rate
        # We use the *updated* Q-value from stage 2 for the TD target
        delta_1 = self.q_stage2[state, action_2] - self.q_stage1[action_1]
        self.q_stage1[action_1] += alpha_stage1 * delta_1

cognitive_model2 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel2)
```

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Exploitation
This model suggests that the participant's core deficit is in the exploration-exploitation trade-off. High anxiety promotes a risk-averse, exploitative strategy, making the participant unwilling to explore uncertain options. This is implemented by having the anxiety score increase the determinism of the choice policy (the softmax `beta`). A small, early preference for one spaceship is rapidly amplified, causing the participant to "get stuck" on that option and never explore the alternative.

```python
class ParticipantModel3(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: High anxiety (`stai`) drives an over-exploitative choice strategy, 
    suppressing exploration. This is modeled by having the `stai` score amplify the 
    softmax inverse temperature (`beta`), making choices more deterministic and 
    greedy. An anxiety sensitivity parameter (`omega`) controls the strength of this effect.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]     (Learning rate)
    beta:  [0, 10]    (Base inverse temperature)
    omega: [0, 10]    (Anxiety sensitivity parameter)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.omega = model_parameters

    def policy_stage1(self) -> np.ndarray:
        """Computes stage-1 action probabilities with anxiety-driven exploitation."""
        # Anxiety increases the determinism of the policy
        effective_beta = self.beta * (1 + self.omega * self.stai)
        return self.softmax(self.q_stage1, effective_beta)

    def policy_stage2(self, state: int) -> np.ndarray:
        """Stage-2 policy is also made more deterministic by anxiety."""
        effective_beta = self.beta * (1 + self.omega * self.stai)
        return self.softmax(self.q_stage2[state], effective_beta)
