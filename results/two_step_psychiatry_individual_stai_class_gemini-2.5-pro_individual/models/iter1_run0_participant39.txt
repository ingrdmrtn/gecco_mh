Here are three new cognitive models to explain the participant's decision-making process.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Impaired Environmental Learning
This model hypothesizes that high anxiety degrades the ability to learn about the more complex, distal parts of the environment. Specifically, anxiety impairs the learning rate for the second-stage choices (the aliens), making the participant's internal model of the world less accurate and slower to update. This weakened model-based information forces a reliance on simpler, habitual learning about the initial choices, which could explain the observed behavioral rigidity and slow adaptation to changing reward contingencies.

```python
class ParticipantModel1(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: High anxiety impairs learning about the second-stage state-action values.
    This degradation of the "world model" weakens the model-based contribution to 
    first-stage choices, promoting less flexible, habitual behavior. The learning rate 
    for the second stage is therefore inversely scaled by the participant's anxiety level.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]              (Base learning rate)
    beta: [0, 10]              (Inverse temperature for choice stochasticity)
    impairment_factor: [0, 1]  (Degree to which anxiety impairs stage-2 learning)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.impairment_factor = model_parameters

    def value_update(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        """
        Updates Q-values using TD learning, but with an anxiety-dependent learning
        rate for the second stage.
        """
        # Stage-2 update is impaired by anxiety
        # Effective learning rate is reduced as STAI and impairment_factor increase
        alpha_stage2_effective = self.alpha * (1 - self.stai * self.impairment_factor)
        
        delta_2 = reward - self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        self.q_stage2[state, action_2] += alpha_stage2_effective * delta_2
        
        # Stage-1 update uses the base learning rate but propagates the newly learned (and potentially less accurate) stage-2 value
        delta_1 = self.q_stage2[state, action_2] - self.q_stage1[action_1]
        self.q_stage1[action_1] += self.alpha * delta_1

cognitive_model1 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel1)
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Asymmetric Learning
This model proposes that anxiety induces a cognitive bias where negative outcomes are weighted more heavily than positive ones during learning. Anxious individuals are often hypervigilant to threats, and this model translates that into an asymmetric learning rule. Worse-than-expected outcomes (negative prediction errors) lead to larger value adjustments than better-than-expected outcomes. This could cause the participant to become overly cautious after a loss or non-reward.

```python
class ParticipantModel2(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: High anxiety leads to increased sensitivity to negative outcomes. 
    This model implements an asymmetric learning rule where the learning rate for 
    negative prediction errors is higher than for positive ones. The magnitude of this 
    asymmetry is scaled by the participant's STAI score.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha_pos: [0, 1]         (Learning rate for positive prediction errors)
    beta: [0, 10]             (Inverse temperature for choice stochasticity)
    neg_sensitivity: [0, 1]   (Anxiety-driven sensitivity to negative outcomes)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha_pos, self.beta, self.neg_sensitivity = model_parameters

    def init_model(self) -> None:
        # The learning rate for negative outcomes is a combination of the base
        # positive rate and an anxiety-modulated bonus.
        # We cap it at 1 to ensure it remains a valid learning rate.
        self.alpha_neg = np.clip(self.alpha_pos + self.neg_sensitivity * self.stai, 0, 1)

    def value_update(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        """
        Updates Q-values using separate learning rates for positive and negative
        prediction errors.
        """
        # Stage-2 update with asymmetric learning
        delta_2 = reward - self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        alpha_2 = self.alpha_neg if delta_2 < 0 else self.alpha_pos
        self.q_stage2[state, action_2] += alpha_2 * delta_2
        
        # Stage-1 update with asymmetric learning
        delta_1 = self.q_stage2[state, action_2] - self.q_stage1[action_1]
        alpha_1 = self.alpha_neg if delta_1 < 0 else self.alpha_pos
        self.q_stage1[action_1] += alpha_1 * delta_1

cognitive_model2 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel2)
```

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Confirmatory Bias
This model suggests that anxiety promotes a confirmatory learning style. When an outcome is observed, an anxious individual may be more inclined to attribute that outcome strongly to their initial choice. This is modeled as an anxiety-driven boost to the magnitude of the prediction error when updating the value of the first-stage (spaceship) choice. This mechanism would cause the values of chosen spaceships to become more extreme (either better or worse) than they otherwise would, entrenching choices and leading to the observed behavioral stickiness.

```python
class ParticipantModel3(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: Anxiety promotes a confirmatory bias, causing individuals to 
    overweight the outcome of their chosen action during the first-stage value update.
    This is implemented by scaling the stage-1 prediction error by an amount 
    proportional to the STAI score, making the value of the chosen spaceship more 
    entrenched and resistant to change.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]               (Base learning rate)
    beta: [0, 10]              (Inverse temperature for choice stochasticity)
    confirmation_bias: [0, 2]   (Strength of the anxiety-driven confirmatory bias)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.confirmation_bias = model_parameters

    def value_update(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        """
        Updates Q-values, but boosts the stage-1 update for the chosen action
        based on the participant's anxiety level.
        """
        # Standard TD update for the second stage
        delta_2 = reward - self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        self.q_stage2[state, action_2] += self.alpha * delta_2
        
        # The update for the first-stage choice is boosted by anxiety
        update_boost = 1 + self.confirmation_bias * self.stai
        
        delta_1 = self.q_stage2[state, action_2] - self.q_stage1[action_1]
        self.q_stage1[action_1] += self.alpha * delta_1 * update_boost
