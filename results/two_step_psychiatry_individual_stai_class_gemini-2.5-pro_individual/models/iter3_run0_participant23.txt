As a cognitive scientist and Python programmer, I will now propose three distinct cognitive models to explain the participant's decision-making process. Each model formalizes a different hypothesis about how this individual's medium anxiety level (STAI score of 0.325) influences their learning and choice strategy in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Asymmetric Learning
This model tests the hypothesis that anxiety, even at medium levels, heightens sensitivity to negative outcomes. The participant is theorized to learn more rapidly from experiences that are worse than expected (negative prediction errors) compared to those that are better than expected. The degree of this learning asymmetry is directly proportional to their trait anxiety.

```python
class ParticipantModel1(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: This model proposes that anxiety induces asymmetric learning, where the
    participant learns more from negative prediction errors than positive ones.
    The learning rate for negative outcomes (`alpha_neg`) is increased relative to a
    baseline rate (`alpha_base`) as a function of the participant's STAI score.
    This reflects a cognitive bias to be more sensitive to punishment or failure,
    a common feature associated with anxiety.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha_base: [0, 1]  (Baseline learning rate)
    beta: [0, 10]       (Inverse temperature for softmax)
    nu: [0, 2]          (Anxiety-driven learning asymmetry parameter)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha_base, self.beta, self.nu = model_parameters

    def value_update(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        """
        Updates Q-values using separate learning rates for positive and negative
        prediction errors, where the negative learning rate is scaled by anxiety.
        """
        # Stage 2 update
        delta_2 = reward - self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        
        # Determine learning rate based on prediction error sign
        alpha_2 = self.alpha_base
        if delta_2 < 0:
            alpha_2 += self.nu * self.stai
        alpha_2 = np.clip(alpha_2, 0, 1) # Ensure learning rate is within [0, 1]
        
        self.q_stage2[state, action_2] += alpha_2 * delta_2
        
        # Stage 1 update
        # The updated Q-value from stage 2 is used as the target for the stage 1 update
        delta_1 = self.q_stage2[state, action_2] - self.q_stage1[action_1]
        
        alpha_1 = self.alpha_base
        if delta_1 < 0:
            alpha_1 += self.nu * self.stai
        alpha_1 = np.clip(alpha_1, 0, 1)

        self.q_stage1[action_1] += alpha_1 * delta_1

cognitive_model1 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel1)
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Modulated Choice Stochasticity
This model explores the idea that trait anxiety affects the consistency of choices. The hypothesis is that a medium level of anxiety might lead to more deliberate and less random behavior, as the participant tries to maintain a sense of control over the task. This is implemented by allowing the STAI score to modulate the `beta` parameter of the softmax function, which controls the exploration-exploitation balance. A positive modulation would make choices more deterministic (exploitative).

```python
class ParticipantModel2(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: This model posits that anxiety modulates the stochasticity of
    decision-making. The participant's STAI score influences the inverse
    temperature parameter (`beta`) of the softmax policy. A positive `beta_anxiety`
    parameter would mean that higher anxiety leads to more deterministic,
    exploitative choices, possibly reflecting a coping mechanism to reduce
    uncertainty by sticking more rigidly to the perceived best option.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]          (Learning rate)
    beta_base: [0, 10]      (Base inverse temperature)
    beta_anxiety: [-10, 10] (Anxiety modulation of choice stochasticity)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta_base, self.beta_anxiety = model_parameters

    def init_model(self) -> None:
        """
        Calculate the effective beta once at the beginning, as STAI is constant.
        """
        # The effective beta is a combination of a base value and an anxiety-scaled component.
        # We clip it to be non-negative.
        self.beta = max(0, self.beta_base + self.beta_anxiety * self.stai)

    def value_update(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        """
        Standard TD learning update. The hypothesis is tested in the policy through
        the anxiety-modulated beta parameter.
        """
        # Stage 2 update
        delta_2 = reward - self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        self.q_stage2[state, action_2] += self.alpha * delta_2
        
        # Stage 1 update
        delta_1 = self.q_stage2[state, action_2] - self.q_stage1[action_1]
        self.q_stage1[action_1] += self.alpha * delta_1

cognitive_model2 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel2)
```

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Negative Outcome Generalization
This model proposes a more complex learning mechanism driven by anxiety: the over-generalization of negative experiences. When the participant receives a disappointing outcome (fewer coins than expected) from an alien on a given planet, they not only devalue that specific alien but also generalize this negative feeling to the *other* alien on the same planet. This "written-off planet" heuristic simplifies future choices and is hypothesized to be stronger in more anxious individuals.

```python
class ParticipantModel3(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: This model suggests that anxiety promotes the generalization of
    negative outcomes. When a reward is worse than expected, the participant not
    only devalues the chosen option but also the other, unchosen option within the
    same state (i.e., on the same planet). The strength of this generalization is
    scaled by the participant's STAI score, reflecting an anxiety-driven bias to
    perceive entire contexts as threatening after a single negative event.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]   (Learning rate)
    beta: [0, 10]   (Inverse temperature for softmax)
    rho: [0, 1]     (Anxiety-driven negative generalization parameter)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.rho = model_parameters

    def value_update(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        """
        Updates Q-values with a standard TD rule for the chosen action, and adds
        an anxiety-modulated generalization update for the unchosen action at stage 2

        """
        # Stage 2 update
        delta_2 = reward - self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        self.q_stage2[state, action_2] += self.alpha * delta_2
        
        # If the outcome was worse than expected, generalize the negative update
        if delta_2 < 0:
            other_action_2 = 1 - action_2
            generalization_strength = self.alpha * self.rho * self.stai
            self.q_stage2[state, other_action_2] += generalization_strength * delta_2
            
        # Stage 1 update (based on the value of the action actually taken)
