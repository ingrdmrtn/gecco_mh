As a cognitive scientist and programmer, I've analyzed this participant's data, noting their high state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) score of 0.725. High anxiety is often associated with distinct patterns in learning and decision-making, such as increased reliance on habits, heightened sensitivity to negative feedback, and distorted beliefs about environmental uncertainty. The participant's initial strong preference for one option, followed by more varied choices, suggests a dynamic learning process influenced by outcomes.

Here are three distinct cognitive models that formalize different hypotheses about how this participant's anxiety might shape their decision-making process.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Driven Perseveration
This model proposes that anxiety drives a conflict between goal-directed action (choosing the spaceship with the highest expected reward) and a simpler, habitual tendency to repeat the last action. High trait anxiety biases the decision system towards this perseverative, stimulus-response habit, particularly in situations of uncertainty. This captures the clinical observation that anxiety can lead to rigid or "stuck" behaviors.

```python
class ParticipantModel1(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: Anxiety arbitrates between a goal-directed (RL) system and a
    simple perseverative system. High trait anxiety (stai) increases the weight
    given to repeating the previous action, irrespective of its learned value.
    This reflects a shift from flexible, goal-directed control to more rigid,
    habitual control under anxiety. The model interpolates between the learned
    Q-values and a vector representing the last action.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]      (Learning rate for the RL system)
    beta: [0, 10]     (Inverse softmax temperature)
    kappa: [0, 1]     (Anxiety sensitivity parameter, scales influence of perseveration)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.kappa = model_parameters

    def init_model(self) -> None:
        """Initialize a vector to track the most recent stage-1 action."""
        self.perseveration_vector = np.zeros(self.n_choices)

    def policy_stage1(self) -> np.ndarray:
        """
        Computes a policy by mixing learned Q-values with a perseveration tendency.
        The mixing weight is determined by the participant's trait anxiety.
        """
        # kappa scales the raw stai score to a weight between 0 and 1
        # This weight determines the influence of the perseveration vector
        w_anxiety = np.clip(self.kappa * self.stai, 0, 1)

        # The final action value is a weighted average of the learned Q-value
        # and the tendency to repeat the last action.
        q_combined = (1 - w_anxiety) * self.q_stage1 + w_anxiety * self.perseveration_vector
        
        return self.softmax(q_combined, self.beta)

    def post_trial(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        """
        After the trial, update the perseveration vector to reflect the choice
        that was just made.
        """
        super().post_trial(action_1, state, action_2, reward)
        # Set the value for the chosen action to 1, others to 0
        self.perseveration_vector.fill(0)
        self.perseveration_vector[action_1] = 1.0

cognitive_model1 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel1)
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Asymmetric Learning
This model hypothesizes that anxiety creates a learning bias, making the participant more sensitive to negative outcomes than positive ones. A neutral outcome (0 coins) is treated as a significant failure, prompting a larger update to value estimates than a positive outcome (1 coin). This "pessimistic learning" style means that non-rewards have a disproportionately strong influence on subsequent choices, a common feature in anxiety where potential threats and losses are overweighted.

```python
class ParticipantModel2(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: Anxiety leads to asymmetric learning, where the agent learns
    more from negative prediction errors (outcomes worse than expected) than
    from positive ones. Trait anxiety (stai) determines the degree of this
    asymmetry, boosting the learning rate specifically for negative events. This
    reflects a cognitive bias to overweight failures and punishments.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha_pos: [0, 1]   (Learning rate for positive prediction errors)
    beta: [0, 10]      (Inverse softmax temperature)
    lambda_anxiety: [0, 1] (Scales anxiety's effect on negative learning rate)
    """

        self.alpha_pos, self.beta, self.lambda_anxiety = model_parameters

    def value_update(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        """
        Updates Q-values using separate learning rates for positive and negative
        prediction errors, with the negative learning rate boosted by anxiety.
        """
        # The learning rate for negative outcomes is the base rate plus an
        # anxiety-dependent term.
        alpha_neg = np.clip(self.alpha_pos + self.lambda_anxiety * self.stai, 0, 1)

        # Stage 2 update
        delta_2 = reward - self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        alpha_2 = self.alpha_pos if delta_2 >= 0 else alpha_neg
        self.q_stage2[state, action_2] += alpha_2 * delta_2
        
        # Stage 1 update
        # The prediction error is based on the updated stage 2 value
        delta_1 = self.q_stage2[state, action_2] - self.q_stage1[action_1]
        # The same learning rate (driven by reward outcome) is applied
        alpha_1 = self.alpha_pos if delta_2 >= 0 else alpha_neg
        self.q_stage1[action_1] += alpha_1 * delta_1

cognitive_model2 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel2)

### Model 3: Anxiety-Corrupted World Model
This model posits that the participant uses a sophisticated, model-based strategy, but their anxiety corrupts their internal "world model." Specifically, anxiety amplifies learning from surprising events when updating their beliefs about the spaceship-to-planet transitions. A rare transition (a surprising event) will be overweighted, causing the participant to believe the environment is more random and unpredictable than it actually is. This distorted mental map of the task structure will lead to suboptimal planning and choice.

```python
class ParticipantModel3(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: Anxiety distorts the learning of the task's transition
    structure. The participant is a model-based agent who learns the
    transition probabilities online. Anxiety amplifies the impact of surprising
    transitions (rare events), causing an overestimation of their likelihood.
    This leads to a corrupted 'world model' and consequently flawed planning.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]     (Learning rate for stage-2 values)
    beta: [0, 10]    (Inverse softmax temperature for planning)
    gamma: [0, 5]     (Scales the anxiety-driven surprise bonus for transition learning)
