As a cognitive scientist and Python programmer, I will propose three distinct models to explain this participant's decision-making patterns. Given the participant's high anxiety score (stai = 0.6875) and their stark, perseverative choice behavior (long streaks of choosing one spaceship, followed by an abrupt switch), the proposed models will focus on how anxiety might induce cognitive inflexibility, uncertainty aversion, and attentional biases.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Driven Patience Depletion

This model hypothesizes that high anxiety reduces an individual's "patience" with a chosen strategy. The participant sticks with a default option, but each time it leads to a worse-than-expected outcome (a negative prediction error), their patience for that option depletes. Higher anxiety accelerates this depletion. Once patience is exhausted, the participant catastrophically devalues the option and switches, explaining the abrupt shift in behavior observed in the data.

```python
import numpy as np

class ParticipantModel1(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: High anxiety reduces "patience" with a chosen strategy. The model
    tracks a patience level for each first-stage choice. Negative prediction errors
    (when outcomes are worse than expected) deplete this patience at a rate scaled
    by anxiety. When patience for an option runs out, its value is catastrophically
    reset, prompting an abrupt switch to the other option.

    alpha: [0, 1]   (learning rate)
    beta: [0, 10]  (inverse temperature)
    omega: [0, 5]   (patience depletion rate for negative outcomes)

        self.alpha, self.beta, self.omega = model_parameters

    def init_model(self) -> None:
        """Initialize patience for each first-stage action."""
        self.patience = np.ones(self.n_choices)

    def value_update(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        """
        Update values using standard TD learning, but with an added mechanism for
        patience depletion and value resetting.
        """
        # Standard stage-2 update
        delta_2 = reward - self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        self.q_stage2[state, action_2] += self.alpha * delta_2
        
        # Stage-1 prediction error
        q_stage2_max = np.max(self.q_stage2[state])
        delta_1 = q_stage2_max - self.q_stage1[action_1]
        
        # Deplete patience if the prediction error is negative
        if delta_1 < 0:
            # Higher anxiety (stai) causes patience to deplete faster
            depletion = self.omega * self.stai * delta_1  # delta_1 is negative
            self.patience[action_1] += depletion

        # Standard stage-1 update
        self.q_stage1[action_1] += self.alpha * delta_1

        # Check for catastrophic devaluation if patience is exhausted
        if self.patience[action_1] <= 0:
            self.q_stage1[action_1] = 0.0  # Reset value to a low baseline
            self.patience[action_1] = 1.0  # Reset patience

cognitive_model1 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel1)
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Aversion to Transition Uncertainty

This model posits that high anxiety creates a strong aversion to uncertainty. In the two-step task, the primary source of environmental uncertainty is the probabilistic transition from the spaceship to the planet. A rare transition is a surprising event. This model proposes that, in addition to standard reward learning, the participant applies an immediate, anxiety-driven penalty to the value of a spaceship choice whenever it leads to a rare (and thus uncertain) transition.

```python
import numpy as np

class ParticipantModel2(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: High anxiety fosters an aversion to environmental uncertainty. This
    is modeled as a heuristic penalty applied to first-stage choices that lead to
    rare (surprising) transitions. The magnitude of this "uncertainty penalty" is
    scaled by the participant's anxiety level, promoting choices that lead to
    more predictable outcomes.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]   (learning rate)
    beta: [0, 10]  (inverse temperature)
    eta: [0, 5]   (base magnitude of the uncertainty penalty)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.eta = model_parameters

    def value_update(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        """
        First, perform standard TD learning. Then, apply an anxiety-driven
        penalty if the transition from stage 1 to stage 2 was rare.
        """
        # Standard TD updates
        delta_2 = reward - self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        self.q_stage2[state, action_2] += self.alpha * delta_2
        
        delta_1 = self.q_stage2[state, action_2] - self.q_stage1[action_1]
        self.q_stage1[action_1] += self.alpha * delta_1
        
        # Check for rare transition and apply penalty
        # self.T is a transition matrix [action, state].
        # T[0,0] and T[1,1] are common transitions. T[0,1] and T[1,0] are rare.
        transition_prob = self.T[action_1, state]
        
        if transition_prob < 0.5:  # This indicates a rare transition
            # The penalty is scaled by both the base parameter and anxiety
            penalty = self.eta * self.stai
            self.q_stage1[action_1] -= penalty

cognitive_model2 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel2)
```

### Model 3: Anxiety-Modulated Attentional Decay

This model formalizes the concept that anxiety narrows attentional focus. When the participant makes a choice, their attention is consumed by processing the outcome, leading them to neglect the alternative option. This is modeled as a value decay process: while the chosen option's value is updated via reinforcement, the unchosen option's value decays towards a neutral baseline. Higher anxiety accelerates this decay, reinforcing perseveration by making the unchosen option seem less valuable over time simply due to neglect.

```python
import numpy as np

class ParticipantModel3(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: High anxiety narrows attentional focus, causing the value of
    unchosen options to be neglected and decay over time. While the chosen
    option's value is updated via reinforcement learning, the unchosen option's
    value decays towards a neutral baseline. Higher anxiety accelerates this
    decay, reinforcing perseverative choice patterns.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]   (learning rate for chosen option)
    beta: [0, 10]  (inverse temperature)
    decay: [0, 1]   (base decay rate for unchosen option)
    """

        self.alpha, self.beta, self.decay = model_parameters

    def value_update(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        """
        Update chosen action via TD learning and apply anxiety-modulated decay
        to the value of the unchosen action.
        """
        # Identify the unchosen action
        unchosen_action = 1 - action_1
        
        # Calculate the effective decay rate, scaled by anxiety
        effective_decay = self.decay * self.stai
        
        # Apply decay to the unchosen action's Q-value (decay towards initial value of 0.5)
        self.q_stage1[unchosen_action] += effective_decay * (0.5 - self.q_stage1[unchosen_action])
        
        # Perform standard TD update for the chosen action
        delta_2 = reward - self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        self.q_stage2[state, action_2] += self.alpha * delta_2
        
        delta_1 = self.q_stage2[state, action_2] - self.q_stage1[action_1]
