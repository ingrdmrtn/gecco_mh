As a cognitive scientist and Python programmer, I will propose three distinct cognitive models to explain the decision-making patterns of this participant. Given their medium anxiety score (STAI = 0.4), each model will incorporate a unique hypothesis about how this trait-level anxiety influences their strategy in the two-step task. The participant's behavior shows a strong preference for one option, with occasional, brief switches, suggesting a degree of behavioral inflexibility which is often associated with anxiety.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Mediated Deficit in Model-Based Control

This first model tests the hypothesis that anxiety impairs goal-directed, "model-based" planning. In this task, a model-based strategy involves learning the spaceship-to-planet transition probabilities and using this knowledge to choose the spaceship leading to the most valuable planet. A simpler, "model-free" strategy just learns the direct value of choosing a spaceship based on past rewards, ignoring the transition structure. This model proposes that the participant uses a hybrid of these two strategies, and their anxiety level dictates the balance. Specifically, higher anxiety is hypothesized to reduce reliance on the computationally demanding model-based system, pushing behavior towards more habitual, model-free control.

```python
class ParticipantModel1(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: This model assumes the participant uses a hybrid of model-free
    (habitual) and model-based (goal-directed) valuation. Anxiety is
    hypothesized to impair the computationally demanding model-based system.
    The weight given to model-based valuation is therefore inversely
    proportional to the participant's STAI score. A higher STAI score leads
    to more model-free, habitual behavior.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]    (Learning rate for value updates)
    beta: [0, 10]   (Softmax inverse temperature for choice stochasticity)
    w_base: [0, 1]   (Base weight for model-based control)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.w_base = model_parameters

    def policy_stage1(self) -> np.ndarray:
        """
        Computes stage-1 choice probabilities based on a weighted average of
        model-free and model-based Q-values. The weight is modulated by anxiety.
        """
        # 1. Model-free values (habitual)
        q_mf = self.q_stage1

        # 2. Model-based values (goal-directed)
        # Find the maximum expected reward from each second-stage planet
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(self.q_stage2, axis=1)
        # Weight these planet values by the transition probabilities
        q_mb = self.T @ max_q_stage2

        # 3. Hybrid valuation
        # The weight 'w' on the model-based system is scaled by (1 - stai).
        # As anxiety increases, w decreases.
        w = self.w_base * (1 - self.stai)
        q_hybrid = (1 - w) * q_mf + w * q_mb

        return self.softmax(q_hybrid, self.beta)

cognitive_model1 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel1)
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Modulated Asymmetric Learning Rates

This model explores the idea that anxiety alters the learning process itself, specifically by increasing sensitivity to negative outcomes. The hypothesis is that individuals with moderate anxiety learn more from outcomes that are worse than expected (negative prediction errors) than from those that are better than expected (positive prediction errors). The participant's tendency to stick with an option might be explained by a reluctance to incur negative feedback from switching. This model implements separate learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors, with the learning rate for negative events being amplified by the participant's STAI score.

```python
class ParticipantModel2(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: This model posits that anxiety induces a learning bias, making
    the participant more sensitive to negative outcomes. It uses separate learning
    rates for positive and negative prediction errors (PEs). The learning rate
    for negative PEs is amplified by the STAI score, causing the participant to
    learn more quickly from outcomes that are worse than expected.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]  (Base learning rate, used for positive PEs)
    beta: [0, 10] (Softmax inverse temperature)
    eta: [0, 1]    (Asymmetry parameter; scales the impact of anxiety on negative PE learning)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.eta = model_parameters

    def value_update(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        """
        Updates Q-values using different learning rates for positive and
        negative prediction errors, where the negative learning rate is
        scaled by the STAI score.
        """
        # Define anxiety-modulated learning rates
        alpha_pos = self.alpha
        alpha_neg = np.clip(self.alpha + self.eta * self.stai, 0, 1)

        # Stage 2 update
        delta_2 = reward - self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        alpha_2 = alpha_neg if delta_2 < 0 else alpha_pos
        self.q_stage2[state, action_2] += alpha_2 * delta_2
        
        # Stage 1 update
        # The TD target for stage 1 is the updated value of the chosen stage 2 action
        td_target_1 = self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        delta_1 = td_target_1 - self.q_stage1[action_1]
        alpha_1 = alpha_neg if delta_1 < 0 else alpha_pos
        self.q_stage1[action_1] += alpha_1 * delta_1

cognitive_model2 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel2)
```

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Inhibition of Exploration

The third model proposes that anxiety leads to a form of cognitive tunneling or risk aversion, manifesting as an active inhibition of switching away from the currently perceived best option. Rather than simply repeating the last action (perseveration), this model suggests that anxiety makes the participant less likely to explore any option that is not currently the most valuable. This is implemented by suppressing the value of the lower-valued first-stage option before the choice is made. The degree of this value suppression is directly proportional to the participant's anxiety score, making them "stick" with what they believe is the best choice.

```python
class ParticipantModel3(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: This model suggests that anxiety promotes risk-averse,
    stick-to-what-you-know behavior by actively suppressing the value of
    less-preferred options. Instead of a simple perseverative bias, this
    is a value-based inhibition of exploration. The Q-value of the option
    with the lower current estimate is down-weighted before the softmax
    choice rule is applied. The strength of this suppression is scaled by
    the participant's STAI score.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]    (Learning rate)
    beta: [0, 10]   (Softmax inverse temperature)
    kappa: [0, 1]   (Suppression strength parameter)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.kappa = model_parameters

    def policy_stage1(self) -> np.ndarray:
        """
        Computes stage-1 probabilities after suppressing the value of the
        currently less-preferred option, with suppression strength modulated by anxiety.
        """
        q_policy = np.copy(self.q_stage1)
        
        # Do not apply suppression if values are equal
        if q_policy[0] != q_policy[1]:
            # Identify the index of the worse option
            worse_option_idx = np.argmin(q_policy)
            
            # Calculate the anxiety-modulated suppression factor
            # A factor of 1 means full suppression, 0 means no suppression.
            suppression_factor = self.kappa * self.stai
            
            # Apply multiplicative suppression to the value of the worse option
            # We scale it by (1 - suppression) to reduce its value.
            q_policy[worse_option_idx] *= (1 - suppression_factor)

        return self.softmax(q_policy, self.beta)
