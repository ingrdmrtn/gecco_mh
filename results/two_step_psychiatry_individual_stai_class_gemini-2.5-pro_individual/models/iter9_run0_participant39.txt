As a cognitive scientist and Python programmer, I've analyzed this participant's data. The prominent behavioral pattern is extreme perseveration: the participant chose spaceship 0 for 34 consecutive trials before exploring the alternative. This rigidity, coupled with a high STAI score of 0.6625, strongly suggests that anxiety is playing a key role in their decision-making strategy, likely by promoting habitual, inflexible behavior and impairing adaptive learning.

Here are three distinct cognitive models that formalize different hypotheses about how high anxiety might lead to this observed pattern.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Driven Cognitive Inertia
This model proposes that anxiety fosters a state of "cognitive inertia," making established value representations resistant to change. When a choice is repeated, the participant becomes less sensitive to new feedback for that option. This is not a choice bias (like a perseveration bonus) but a *learning* bias. Anxious individuals, once settled on a strategy, may discount subsequent evidence, making their habits "stickier" and harder to update, which explains long streaks of choosing the same option.

```python
class ParticipantModel1(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: High anxiety induces 'cognitive inertia', making established
    habits resistant to new evidence. The model implements this by reducing the
    learning rate (alpha) for an action that is a repetition of the previous
    trial's choice. This suppression of learning is scaled by the individual's
    anxiety level (stai), causing anxious participants to become 'stuck' in
    their ways and less sensitive to feedback that contradicts their current strategy.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]      (Base learning rate)
    beta: [0, 10]      (Inverse temperature for choice stochasticity)
    inertia: [0, 1]    (Strength of the resistance to learning for repeated actions)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.inertia = model_parameters

    def value_update(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        """
        Updates Q-values with a learning rate that is reduced if the
        current stage-1 action is the same as the last one.
        """
        alpha_effective = self.alpha
        
        # Check if the action is a repetition of the last trial's action
        if self.last_action1 is not None and action_1 == self.last_action1:
            # Calculate the reduction factor based on anxiety and inertia parameter
            reduction = self.inertia * self.stai
            # Apply the reduction to the learning rate
            alpha_effective *= (1.0 - min(reduction, 1.0))

        # Standard TD updates using the effective (potentially reduced) learning rate
        delta_2 = reward - self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        self.q_stage2[state, action_2] += alpha_effective * delta_2
        
        delta_1 = self.q_stage2[state, action_2] - self.q_stage1[action_1]
        self.q_stage1[action_1] += alpha_effective * delta_1

cognitive_model1 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel1)
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Planning Myopia
This model hypothesizes that anxiety impairs forward planning by introducing a myopic bias. Instead of relying solely on a computationally demanding model-based evaluation (i.e., thinking through the likely transitions and outcomes), the anxious individual's choice is heavily contaminated by the simple, cached "model-free" value of the spaceship. This creates a self-reinforcing loop: choosing a spaceship because its cached value is high reinforces that same cached value, making it progressively harder to switch away, even if the forward-looking model suggests it's suboptimal.

```python
class ParticipantModel2(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: Anxiety leads to 'planning myopia', where decisions are
    increasingly driven by simple cached values rather than forward planning.
    This model computes a hybrid stage-1 value, mixing a forward-looking,
    model-based value with the stored, backward-looking model-free value.
    Anxiety (stai) increases the weight on the myopic model-free value,
    causing the participant to rely more on habit and less on planning.

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]          (Learning rate)
    beta: [0, 10]          (Inverse temperature for choice stochasticity)
    myopia_factor: [0, 1]   (Degree to which anxiety promotes model-free valuation)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.myopia_factor = model_parameters

    def policy_stage1(self) -> np.ndarray:
        """
        Computes stage-1 choice probabilities based on a mix of model-based
        and model-free values, with anxiety controlling the mixture.
        """
        # 1. Calculate the forward-looking model-based value of each spaceship
        q_stage1_mb = np.zeros(self.n_choices)
        planet_values = np.max(self.q_stage2, axis=1)
        for choice in range(self.n_choices):
            # Q_MB(spaceship) = sum[P(planet|spaceship) * V(planet)]
            q_stage1_mb[choice] = np.dot(self.T[choice, :], planet_values)

        # 2. Get the cached model-free values
        q_stage1_mf = self.q_stage1

        # 3. Anxiety determines the weight of the myopic (MF) influence
        w = self.myopia_factor * self.stai
        w = min(w, 1.0)  # Ensure weight is between 0 and 1

        # 4. Combine the values
        q_effective = (1 - w) * q_stage1_mb + w * q_stage1_mf
        
        return self.softmax(q_effective, self.beta)

cognitive_model2 = make_cognitive_model(ParticipantModel2)
```

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Suppression of Learning from Surprising Events
This model posits that anxiety impairs the cognitive processing of surprising events. In this task, "surprise" occurs during a rare transition (e.g., choosing the spaceship that usually goes to Planet X but ending up at Planet Y). These surprising events are crucial for building an accurate mental model of the task structure. This model proposes that anxious individuals suppress learning from these events. By failing to integrate information from rare transitions, their world model remains simplistic, promoting reliance on the most common, habitual action sequence.

```python
class ParticipantModel3(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: High anxiety impairs the integration of surprising information,
    specifically by suppressing learning following rare state transitions.
    This prevents the participant from building a correct model of the task,
    fostering a reliance on simple, model-free habits. The degree of learning
    suppression after a rare transition is scaled by the participant's anxiety (stai).

    Parameter Bounds:
    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]        (Base learning rate)
    beta: [0, 10]        (Inverse temperature for choice stochasticity)
    suppression: [0, 1]  (Strength of learning suppression after rare transitions)
    """

    def unpack_parameters(self, model_parameters: tuple) -> None:
        self.alpha, self.beta, self.suppression = model_parameters

    def value_update(self, action_1: int, state: int, action_2: int, reward: float) -> None:
        """
        Updates Q-values with a learning rate that is suppressed if the
        transition from stage 1 to stage 2 was a 'rare' one.
        """

        # (e.g., action 0 -> state 0; action 1 -> state 1)
        is_common_transition = (action_1 == state)
        
        alpha_effective = self.alpha
        
        if not is_common_transition:
            # If the transition was rare, suppress the learning rate
            suppression_factor = self.suppression * self.stai
            alpha_effective *= (1.0 - min(suppression_factor, 1.0))
            
        # Perform TD updates with the effective learning rate
        delta_2 = reward - self.q_stage2[state, action_2]
        self.q_stage2[state, action_2] += alpha_effective * delta_2
