As a cognitive scientist and Python programmer, I've converted the provided model-fitting code into a simulation function. This function can generate synthetic behavioral data based on the logic of any cognitive model that adheres to the `CognitiveModelBase` structure.

The simulation faithfully replicates the trial-by-trial process a participant would experience: making a choice, observing a transition, making a second choice, and receiving a reward. Crucially, after each trial, it calls the model's internal learning and update mechanisms, allowing the simulated agent's preferences and strategies to evolve over time, just as a human participant's would.

    Simulate a two-step task trajectory from a cognitive model class.
    
    This function generates a sequence of choices, states, and rewards
    based on the decision-making logic encapsulated within the provided

    Task structure:
      - Stage 1: choose action in {0,1}
      - Transition: state in {0,1} sampled from model.T[action_1]
      - Stage 2: choose action in {0,1} conditioned on state

          state 0: [drift1[t], drift2[t]] for actions 0/1
