As a cognitive scientist and Python programmer, I've taken the model fitting code you provided and converted it into a simulation function. This function can generate behavioral data from any model that adheres to the `CognitiveModelBase` structure, such as the `ParticipantModel3` you've defined.

The simulation faithfully follows the logic of the two-step task and the agent's learning process:
1.  **Initialization**: It sets up the model with the specified parameters and anxiety score.
2.  **Trial Loop**: It iterates through each trial.
3.  **Decision & Transition**: In each trial, it uses the model's current policy (`policy_stage1`, `policy_stage2`) to make choices and transitions between states based on the task's probability structure (`model.T`).
4.  **Outcome & Learning**: It determines the reward based on the provided drifting probabilities and then calls the model's `value_update` method to allow the agent to learn from the outcome.
5.  **Data Logging**: It records the agent's choices, the resulting states, and the rewards at each step.

This simulation is a powerful tool for generating predictions, testing hypotheses, and understanding the behavioral patterns that emerge from a specific cognitive model.
