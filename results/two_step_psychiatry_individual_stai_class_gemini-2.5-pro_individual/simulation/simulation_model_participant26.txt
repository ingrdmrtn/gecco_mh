Of course. As a cognitive scientist and Python programmer, I'd be happy to convert the model-fitting code into a simulation function.

The provided example for the simulation function is already a robust, generic template that works for any model inheriting from `CognitiveModelBase`, including `ParticipantModel2`. The key is that the simulation loop calls the model's methods (like `policy_stage1` and `value_update`) at each step. This ensures that the specific logic of `ParticipantModel2`—namely, the anxiety-scaled perseveration bias—is correctly applied during the generation of choices.

Below is the simulation function, adapted from the provided template to match your specified return variable names.

```python
import numpy as np
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# simulation function depends on them.
