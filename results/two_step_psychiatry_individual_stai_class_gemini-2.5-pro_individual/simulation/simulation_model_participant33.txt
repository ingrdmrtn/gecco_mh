An excellent cognitive model. It elegantly captures a specific, testable hypothesis about the influence of anxiety on decision-making. To test this model's predictions and generate synthetic data, we need a simulation function that can "run" the model as if it were a participant.

Here is the simulation code that translates your model-fitting framework into a generative, forward-looking process. This function takes your `ParticipantModel2` class (or any other model built on the same `CognitiveModelBase`), its parameters, and the task environment, then produces a trial-by-trial behavioral trajectory.

    HYPOTHESIS: This model suggests that anxiety induces behavioral perseveration, 
    or a "stickiness" to recent choices. Anxious individuals may be less flexible 
    and more likely to repeat an action, irrespective of its recent outcomes. This 
    is implemented as a bonus value added to the most recently chosen stage-1 action. 
    The magnitude of this stickiness bonus is directly scaled by the participant's 
    STAI score, such that higher anxiety leads to stronger perseveration.

    Simulate a two-step task trajectory from a cognitive model class.

    This function instantiates a model and simulates its behavior trial-by-trial,
    generating choices based on the model's policies and updating its internal
    state based on the outcomes.

    Task structure:
      - Stage 1: Choose action in {0, 1}.
      - Transition: Reach state in {0, 1} based on transition probabilities.
      - Stage 2: Choose action in {0, 1} conditioned on the state.
      - Reward: Receive a reward based on drifting reward probabilities.

        Trial-wise reward probabilities for the 4 second-stage (state, action) pairs.
    seed : int or None, optional
        Seed for the random number generator for reproducibility.
