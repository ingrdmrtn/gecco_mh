To simulate the behavior of `ParticipantModel3`, we need to instantiate the class, iterate through trials, and use its internal policy methods (`policy_stage1`, `policy_stage2`) to make decisions based on the random number generator. Crucially, we must ensure the model's internal state (Q-values, history) is updated exactly as it is during fitting via `value_update` and `post_trial`.

Here is the simulation code:

```python
import numpy as np

def simulate_model(
    ModelClass,
    n_trials: int,
    stai: float,
    model_parameters: tuple,
    drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4,
    seed: int | None = None,
):
    """
    Simulate a two-step task trajectory using ParticipantModel3 (or compatible subclasses).

    Task structure:
      - Stage 1: choose action_1 in {0,1} based on Q-values + Anxiety-driven Stickiness.
      - Transition: state in {0,1} sampled from model.T[action_1].
      - Stage 2: choose action_2 in {0,1} conditioned on state.
      - Reward: sampled from drifting reward probabilities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ModelClass : type
        The class definition (e.g., ParticipantModel3).
    n_trials : int
        Number of trials to simulate.
    stai : float
        Participant anxiety score.
    model_parameters : tuple
        Parameters (alpha, beta, phi) for ParticipantModel3.
    drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 : array-like (length n_trials)
        Trial-wise reward probabilities for the 4 (state, action) pairs.
    seed : int or None
        RNG seed.

    Returns
    -------
    stage1_choice : np.ndarray
    state2        : np.ndarray
    stage2_choice : np.ndarray
    reward        : np.ndarray
