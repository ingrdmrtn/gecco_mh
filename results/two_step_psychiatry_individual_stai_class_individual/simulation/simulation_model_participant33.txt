To simulate the behavior of `ParticipantModel2`, we need to instantiate the class, iterate through the trials, and at each step:
1.  Ask the model for Stage 1 probabilities (which includes the anxiety-modulated stickiness logic).
2.  Sample an action.
3.  Sample a state transition based on the model's transition matrix.
4.  Ask the model for Stage 2 probabilities.
5.  Sample a Stage 2 action.
6.  Determine the reward based on the provided drifting probabilities.
7.  Update the model's internal state (Q-values and history) so the stickiness logic works for the next trial.

Here is the simulation code:

```python
import numpy as np

def simulate_model(
    ModelClass,
    n_trials: int,
    stai: float,
    model_parameters: tuple,
    drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4,
    seed: int | None = None,
):
    """
    Simulate a two-step task trajectory using ParticipantModel2 (or compatible classes).

    Task structure:
      - Stage 1: choose action_1 in {0,1} (influenced by anxiety-driven stickiness)
      - Transition: state in {0,1} sampled from model.T[action_1]
      - Stage 2: choose action_2 in {0,1} conditioned on state
      - Reward: sampled from drifting reward probabilities

    Parameters
    ----------
    ModelClass : type
        The class to instantiate (e.g., ParticipantModel2).
    n_trials : int
        Number of trials to simulate.
    stai : float
        Participant anxiety score.
    model_parameters : tuple
        Parameters expected by ModelClass.unpack_parameters (alpha, beta, stickiness).
    drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 : array-like (length n_trials)
        Trial-wise reward probabilities for the 4 (state, action) pairs.
    seed : int or None
        RNG seed.

    Returns

    stage1_choice : np.ndarray
