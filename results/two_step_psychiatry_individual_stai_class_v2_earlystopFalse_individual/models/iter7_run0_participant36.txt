Here are three new cognitive models that hypothesize different mechanisms for how anxiety (STAI) modulates decision-making in this task.

```python
class ParticipantModel1(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: Anxiety increases sensitivity to 'disappointment' (negative prediction errors).
    
    Anxious individuals often exhibit a negativity bias, reacting more strongly to 
    outcomes that are worse than expected compared to outcomes that are better than expected.
    This model implements this by scaling the learning rate when the prediction error (delta) 
    is negative. Higher anxiety leads to faster learning from disappointments, potentially 
    causing the participant to quickly abandon options that fail to reward.

    -----------------
    alpha: [0, 1]          # Base learning rate
    beta: [0, 10]          # Inverse temperature
    disappoint_k: [0, 5]   # Scaling factor for negative prediction errors based on STAI

        # If the outcome was worse than expected (delta < 0), boost learning rate by anxiety

        if delta_2 < 0:
            lr_2 *= (1.0 + self.disappoint_k * self.stai)

        self.q_stage1[action_1] += lr_1 * delta_1

class ParticipantModel2(CognitiveModelBase):
    """
    HYPOTHESIS: Anxiety dampens the subjective value of positive rewards (Anhedonia).
    
    High anxiety is often associated with reduced positive affect or anhedonia. 
    This model hypothesizes that anxious individuals perceive the 'gold coin' (reward=1) 
    as having less subjective value than non-anxious individuals. 
    The effective reward signal is scaled down by STAI, leading to lower Q-values 
    and potentially reduced motivation to pursue rewards (appearing as more noise/exploration 
    if beta is not sufficiently high to compensate).

    HYPOTHESIS: Anxiety increases temporal discounting (Myopia).
    
    Anxious individuals may focus excessively on immediate outcomes and struggle to

    decreases as STAI increases. High anxiety leads to 'myopic' Stage 1 choices 
    because the future value of Stage 2 is heavily discounted.
