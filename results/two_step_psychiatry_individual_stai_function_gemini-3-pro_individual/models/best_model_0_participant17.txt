    Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Choice Stickiness.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety (stai) drives perseveration (stickiness). The participant
    receives an additional 'bonus' to the action value of the choice made in the 
    previous trial, scaled by their anxiety level.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting between Model-Based (1) and Model-Free (0).
