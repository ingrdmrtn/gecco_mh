    Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Choice Perseveration.
    
    Hypothesis: High anxiety increases cognitive load or risk aversion, leading to 
    "stickiness" or perseveration. Anxious participants are more likely to repeat 
    their previous first-stage choice regardless of the outcome, effectively adding 
    a bonus to the previously chosen option.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Model-based weight.
    - stickiness_sensitivity: [0, 5] How strongly STAI increases choice repetition.
      Bonus = stickiness_sensitivity * stai.
