    Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Perseveration (Stickiness).
    
    Hypothesis: High anxiety increases the tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice 
    (perseveration), serving as a safety behavior or avoidance of decision effort ("stickiness").
    This model adds a 'stickiness' bonus to the Q-value of the previously chosen action,
    where the magnitude of the bonus is scaled by the participant's STAI score.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for Q-values.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature (choice consistency).
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting between Model-Based (1) and Model-Free (0) values.
    perseveration_base: [0, 2] - Baseline bonus added to the previously chosen action.
    stai_p_sens: [0, 2] - Sensitivity parameter: how much STAI increases the perseveration bonus.
