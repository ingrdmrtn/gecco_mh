Here are three cognitive models designed to explain the participant's behavior, incorporating their STAI (anxiety) score into the decision-making process.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Hybrid
This model posits that anxiety (STAI) shifts the balance between Model-Based (planning) and Model-Free (habitual) control. Higher anxiety is hypothesized to reduce cognitive resources for complex planning, pushing the agent towards model-free learning. The mixing parameter `w` is a function of the STAI score.

    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free Reinforcement Learning where the mixing weight
    is modulated by the participant's anxiety (STAI) score.
    
    Hypothesis: Higher anxiety (STAI) reduces model-based control (lower w),
    relying more on habitual, model-free strategies due to cognitive load.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    w_base: [0, 1] - Baseline weight for model-based control (0=MF, 1=MB).
    stai_sensitivity: [0, 5] - How strongly STAI reduces the model-based weight.

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Learning Rate Asymmetry
This model focuses on how anxiety affects *learning* from outcomes rather than the planning strategy. It assumes medium-to-high anxiety participants are more sensitive to negative outcomes (or lack of reward) than positive ones. The model splits the learning rate into positive (`alpha_pos`) and negative (`alpha_neg`) components, where the negative learning rate is amplified by the STAI score.

    Parameters:
    lr_base: [0, 1] - Base learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    stai_amp: [0, 5] - Amplification factor for negative learning rate based on STAI.

### Model 3: Anxiety-Induced Exploratory Noise (Inverse Temperature Modulation)
This model posits that anxiety affects the consistency of choices (exploration vs. exploitation). The STAI score is used to modulate the inverse temperature parameter (`beta`). Specifically, for a "medium" anxiety participant, this model tests the hypothesis that anxiety leads to more erratic behavior (higher noise/lower beta) or rigid behavior (higher beta).

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """

    is modulated by STAI.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety impacts decision consistency. 
    Here, we model beta as: beta_effective = beta_base * exp(stai * effect_param).
    If effect_param is negative, anxiety increases randomness (lowers beta).
    If positive, anxiety increases rigidity (increases beta).
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Update rate for reward probabilities.
    beta_base: [0, 10] - Baseline inverse temperature.
    stai_effect: [0, 2] - Coefficient determining direction and magnitude of STAI on beta. 
                          (We treat 0-1 as reducing beta, >1 as increasing beta for flexibility
