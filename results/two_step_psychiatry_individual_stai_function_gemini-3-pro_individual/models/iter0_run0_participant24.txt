Here are three cognitive models that incorporate the STAI anxiety score into the decision-making process for the two-step task.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Balance between Model-Based and Model-Free Control
This model hypothesizes that anxiety (STAI) shifts the balance between goal-directed (Model-Based) and habitual (Model-Free) control. Specifically, higher anxiety might impair Model-Based planning due to cognitive load or worry, leading to a greater reliance on Model-Free learning. The `w` parameter (mixing weight) is modulated by the STAI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    This model assumes anxiety (STAI) modulates the trade-off between Model-Based (MB) 
    and Model-Free (MF) control strategies.
    
    Hypothesis: Higher anxiety reduces cognitive resources for MB planning, 
    decreasing the weight 'w' placed on MB values.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    w_base: [0, 1] - Baseline weight for Model-Based control (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB).
    stai_sensitivity: [0, 1] - How strongly STAI reduces the MB weight.

### Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Learning Rate Bias (Punishment Sensitivity)
This model posits that anxiety affects how participants learn from positive versus negative outcomes. Specifically, anxious individuals may be more sensitive to a lack of reward (0 coins), interpreting it as a stronger error signal than a gain (1 coin). This manifests as separate learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors, where the negative learning rate is amplified by the STAI score.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    This model assumes anxiety (STAI) modulates sensitivity to negative outcomes.
    
    Hypothesis: Higher anxiety leads to a higher learning rate for negative prediction errors
    (when reward is less than expected), reflecting a bias towards avoiding failure.
    
    Parameters:
    alpha_pos: [0, 1] - Learning rate for positive prediction errors (better than expected).
    alpha_neg_base: [0, 1] - Base learning rate for negative prediction errors.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    stai_amp: [0, 1] - How much STAI amplifies the negative learning rate.

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    # Using a pure Model-Based approach for Stage 1 choice generation to isolate

    q_stage2 = np.zeros((2, 2))

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Choice Randomness (Noise)
This model suggests that anxiety acts as a distractor or noise generator. Instead of altering the learning process or the balance of strategies, anxiety simply makes choices more stochastic (noisier). The `beta` (inverse temperature) parameter, which controls exploration/exploitation, is reduced as STAI increases, leading to more random behavior regardless of value differences.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    This model assumes anxiety (STAI) increases decision noise (exploration).
    
    Hypothesis: High anxiety acts as cognitive interference, effectively lowering 
    the inverse temperature (beta), making choices more random and less sensitive 
    to learned value differences.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Standard Q-learning rate.
    beta_max: [0, 10] - The maximum inverse temperature (for a person with 0 anxiety).
    stai_noise: [0, 10] - Scaling factor for how much STAI reduces beta.

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    # We ensure beta doesn't go below 0.
    beta_eff = np.maximum(beta_max - (stai_noise * stai_val), 0.0)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
