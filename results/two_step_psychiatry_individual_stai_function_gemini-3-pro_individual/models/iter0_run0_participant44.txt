Here are three cognitive models designed to capture the behavior of a participant with high anxiety (STAI = 0.75) in a two-step decision task.

### Cognitive Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Model-Based/Model-Free Hybrid
This model hypothesizes that high anxiety shifts the balance between goal-directed (Model-Based) and habitual (Model-Free) control. Specifically, higher anxiety (STAI) is modeled to reduce the weight of Model-Based planning (`w`), making the agent rely more on simple Model-Free reinforcement.

```python

    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free Reinforcement Learning.
    
    Hypothesis: High anxiety (STAI) reduces the 'w' parameter (weight of model-based control),
    leading to more habitual, model-free behavior.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - w_base: [0, 1] Baseline weight for model-based control (before anxiety modulation).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_base = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0] # STAI is a scalar, but passed as an array

    # We clip to ensure it stays in [0, 1]
    w = w_base * (1.0 - stai_score)
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)

        # Q1(a1) <- Q1(a1) + alpha * (Q2(s, a2) - Q1(a1))
        # Note: In standard 2-step models, the MF update often uses the Q-value of the chosen 2nd stage action
        # as the target, or the reward directly if using lambda=1. Here we use simple TD(0).
        # We use the *updated* Q2 value or the value before update? Standard is usually before.

        # We will use the value *before* the update for the TD error to be standard.
        # So we need to back-track the update slightly or store the old value.

        # The template has delta_stage2 lines, but we did the update directly above. 
        # To strictly follow the "FILL IN" instruction style, here is the logic separated:
        # (This is redundant to the code above but fits the structure requested)

### Cognitive Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Loss Aversion
This model hypothesizes that high anxiety leads to increased sensitivity to negative outcomes (or lack of reward). Instead of a single learning rate, the model splits learning into positive (`alpha_pos`) and negative (`alpha_neg`) updates. High anxiety (STAI) amplifies the learning rate for negative prediction errors (when reward is 0), making the participant quicker to abandon actions that fail to pay out.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Asymmetric Learning Rate Model (Loss Aversion).
    
    Hypothesis: High anxiety increases the learning rate for negative prediction errors 
    (disappointments), leading to faster abandonment of unrewarded options.

    - alpha_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors (Reward = 1).
    - alpha_neg_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate for negative prediction errors (Reward = 0).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - lambda_param: [0, 1] Eligibility trace (0 = pure TD, 1 = Monte Carlo).

    alpha_pos, alpha_neg_base, beta, lambda_param = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Anxiety modulation: Anxiety increases sensitivity to negative outcomes.
    # alpha_neg scales up with STAI.
    alpha_neg = alpha_neg_base + (1.0 - alpha_neg_base) * stai_score
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)

### Cognitive Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Exploration (Inverse Temperature Modulation)
This model hypothesizes that anxiety affects the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Specifically, high anxiety is modeled as "noise" or uncertainty that lowers the inverse temperature (`beta`), making choices more random (higher exploration/randomness) rather than strictly value-maximizing.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Modulated Inverse Temperature (Exploration/Noise).
    
    Hypothesis: High anxiety acts as cognitive noise, reducing the precision of choices.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1]
    - beta_base: [0, 10] The maximum inverse temperature (at 0 anxiety).
    - lambda_param: [0, 1] Eligibility trace parameter connecting stage 2 reward to stage 1.

    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]

    # If STAI is 1.0 (max), beta is halved (or reduced significantly).
