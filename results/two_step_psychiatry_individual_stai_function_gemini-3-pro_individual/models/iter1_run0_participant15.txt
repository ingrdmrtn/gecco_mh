Here are three new cognitive models based on the provided template and participant data.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Learning Rate
This model hypothesizes that anxiety affects the **rate of learning** (neuroplasticity/updating). High anxiety often correlates with a heightened sensitivity to prediction errors. Here, the STAI score modulates the learning rate: higher anxiety leads to faster (or more volatile) updating of value expectations.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model with Anxiety-Modulated Learning Rate.
    
    This model assumes the balance between Model-Based and Model-Free is constant (w),
    but the speed at which the participant updates their Model-Free values depends on anxiety.
    Effective Learning Rate = lr_base * (1 + stai_mod * (stai - 0.4))
    
    Parameters:
    lr_base: [0, 1] Baseline learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB).
    stai_mod: [0, 1] Magnitude of anxiety's effect on learning rate.
    """
    lr_base, beta, w, stai_mod = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_val = stai[0]
    
    # Modulate learning rate by STAI (centered approx around median 0.4)
    # If stai_mod is high, anxious people have much higher learning rates.
    learning_rate = lr_base * (1.0 + stai_mod * (stai_val - 0.4))
    learning_rate = np.clip(learning_rate, 0.0, 1.0)
  
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Combine MB and MF values

        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[a1]

        # policy for the second choice
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)

        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[a2]

        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] - q_stage1_mf[a1]
        q_stage1_mf[a1] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Choice Rigidity (Inverse Temperature)
This model hypothesizes that anxiety affects the **exploration/exploitation trade-off**. High anxiety is often linked to behavioral inhibition or rigidity. Here, STAI modulates `beta` (inverse temperature). Higher STAI increases `beta`, making choices more deterministic (sticking strictly to the highest value option) and reducing random exploration.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """

    # We scale by 10 to ensure the parameter has a meaningful impact range within [0,1]

### Model 3: Anxiety-Induced Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model hypothesizes that anxiety leads to **perseveration** (repetitive behavior), often viewed as a "safety behavior" to reduce uncertainty. The model adds a "stickiness bonus" to the previously chosen action in Stage 1. The magnitude of this bonus is directly scaled by the participant's STAI score.
