Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate STAI scores to explain individual variability in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Learning Rate (Stress-Blunted Learning)
This model hypothesizes that high anxiety impairs the learning process itself, rather than just the balance between systems. High anxiety (high STAI) acts as a noise factor or distractor, reducing the effective learning rate. This reflects literature suggesting anxiety consumes cognitive resources, making updating value representations less efficient.

```python

    """
    Anxiety-Modulated Learning Rate Model.
    
    Hypothesis: High anxiety (STAI) reduces the effective learning rate, 
    making the participant slower to update values based on prediction errors.
    The effective learning rate is: alpha_base * (1 - stai * sensitivity).
    
    Bounds:
    alpha_base: [0, 1]
    beta: [0, 10]
    w: [0, 1] (Fixed mixing weight for MB/MF balance)
    sensitivity: [0, 1] (How strongly anxiety dampens learning)
    """
    alpha_base, beta, w, sensitivity = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_val = stai[0] 

    # Effective learning rate is dampened by anxiety
    # If sensitivity is 0, anxiety has no effect. If 1, high anxiety kills learning.
    learning_rate = alpha_base * (1.0 - (stai_val * sensitivity))
    # Ensure learning rate stays non-negative
    learning_rate = max(0.0, learning_rate)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    # Initialize Q-values
    q_stage1_mf = np.ones(2) * 0.5
    q_stage2_mf = np.ones((2, 2)) * 0.5

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Exploratory Noise (Inverse Temperature Modulation)
This model posits that anxiety affects the decision/action selection phase rather than the learning or valuation phase. Specifically, higher anxiety increases decision noise (lowers the inverse temperature $\beta$). This aligns with theories that anxiety can lead to erratic behavior or "panic," reducing the ability to consistently exploit known high-value options.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Induced Exploratory Noise Model.
    
    Hypothesis: Higher anxiety leads to more stochastic (noisier) choices.
    This is modeled by scaling the inverse temperature (beta) by the STAI score.
    Effective beta = beta_base / (1 + stai * noise_factor).
    Higher STAI -> Lower Effective Beta -> More Randomness.
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0, 1]

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Perseveration
This model suggests that anxious individuals are more prone to "sticking" with their previous choices (perseveration), perhaps as a safety behavior or to reduce cognitive load. The model adds a "stickiness" bonus to the previously chosen action, and the magnitude of this stickiness is scaled by the STAI score.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """

    Bonus = pers_param * stai.
