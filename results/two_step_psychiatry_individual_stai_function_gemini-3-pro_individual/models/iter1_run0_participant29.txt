Here are three new cognitive models based on the provided template and participant data.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Exploration (Beta)
This model hypothesizes that anxiety disrupts the precision of action selection. High anxiety functions as a "noise" parameter, reducing the inverse temperature (`beta`). This leads to more stochastic (random) behavior in anxious participants, regardless of the calculated values of the options.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model where Anxiety (STAI) modulates choice stochasticity (Beta).
    
    Hypothesis: Higher anxiety increases decision noise (lowers beta), making 
    choices less deterministic with respect to value differences.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Rate of Q-value updating.
    beta_base: [0,10] Baseline inverse temperature (precision) for low anxiety.
    w: [0,1] Weighting parameter (0=Model-Free, 1=Model-Based).
    stai_beta_decay: [0,10] Factor by which STAI reduces beta.
                     beta_eff = beta_base / (1 + stai * decay).
    """
    learning_rate, beta_base, w, stai_beta_decay = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]

    # STAI modulates Beta: Higher anxiety -> Lower Beta (more noise)
    beta_eff = beta_base / (1.0 + (stai_score * stai_beta_decay))

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        a1 = int(action_1[trial])
        s_idx = int(state[trial])
        a2 = int(action_2[trial])
        r = reward[trial]

        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[a2]

```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Perseveration
This model hypothesizes that anxiety leads to "safety-seeking" or rigid behavior, manifesting as a tendency to repeat the previous choice (perseveration), regardless of the reward outcome. The degree of stickiness is determined by the STAI score.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):

    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
    w: [0,1] Weighting parameter (MB vs MF).
    stai_stickiness: [0,5] Additional value added to the previously chosen action
                     scaled by STAI score.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w, stai_stickiness = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]

    # Perseveration bonus scaled by anxiety
    stickiness_bonus = stai_score * stai_stickiness

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)

        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        # Add Stickiness Bonus to the previous action
        if last_action_1 != -1:
            q_net[last_action_1] += stickiness_bonus

### Model 3: Anxiety-Modulated Learning Rate
This model hypothesizes that anxiety increases the volatility of beliefs. Anxious individuals may over-update their value estimates in response to prediction errors (both positive and negative), leading to a higher effective learning rate.

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):

    causing participants to over-react to recent outcomes.
    
    Parameters:
    lr_base: [0,1] Base learning rate.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
    w: [0,1] Weighting parameter (MB vs MF).
