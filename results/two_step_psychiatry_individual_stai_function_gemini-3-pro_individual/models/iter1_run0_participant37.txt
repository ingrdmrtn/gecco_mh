Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the participant's STAI (anxiety) score into the decision-making process.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Negativity Bias
This model hypothesizes that anxiety creates an asymmetry in learning. Specifically, high anxiety (high STAI) amplifies the learning rate for negative prediction errors (worse-than-expected outcomes), reflecting a "negativity bias" or hypersensitivity to punishment/omission of reward.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with Anxiety-Modulated Negativity Bias.
    
    Hypothesis: Higher anxiety leads to a higher learning rate specifically for
    negative prediction errors (omission of reward), causing the participant
    to react more strongly to failures than successes.
    
    Parameters:
    lr_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate for positive outcomes.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (1=Pure MB, 0=Pure MF).
    stai_neg_boost: [0, 1] Additional learning rate added for negative errors, scaled by STAI.
    """
    lr_base, beta, w, stai_neg_boost = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]

    # Calculate the boosted learning rate for negative errors
    # We clip to ensure the total learning rate doesn't exceed 1.0
    lr_neg = np.clip(lr_base + (stai_neg_boost * stai_score), 0.0, 1.0)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Model-Based Value Calculation
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Hybrid Value Calculation
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        # Softmax Choice 1
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[int(action_1[trial])]
        
        state_idx = int(state[trial])
        a1 = int(action_1[trial])
        a2 = int(action_2[trial])

        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---
        # Standard Softmax on Stage 2 MF values
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[a2]

        # --- Updates with Negativity Bias ---
        
        # Stage 1 Update (TD-error between Stage 2 value and Stage 1 value)
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] - q_stage1_mf[a1]
        # Use lr_neg if delta is negative, lr_base otherwise
        alpha_1 = lr_neg if delta_stage1 < 0 else lr_base
        q_stage1_mf[a1] += alpha_1 * delta_stage1

        # Stage 2 Update (TD-error between Reward and Stage 2 value)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2]
        # Use lr_neg if delta is negative, lr_base otherwise
        alpha_2 = lr_neg if delta_stage2 < 0 else lr_base
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] += alpha_2 * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Decision Noise
This model hypothesizes that anxiety acts as a disruptor to cognitive control, increasing decision noise. High anxiety lowers the effective inverse temperature (`beta`), flattening the softmax curve and making choices more stochastic (less driven by value differences).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with Anxiety-Induced Decision Noise.
    
    Hypothesis: High anxiety introduces noise into the decision process,
    effectively lowering the beta parameter (inverse temperature).
    Higher STAI scores result in more random exploration/errors.
    
    Parameters:
    lr: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature (for 0 anxiety).
    w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (1=Pure MB, 0=Pure MF).
    stai_noise: [0, 1] Factor by which anxiety reduces beta.
    """
    lr, beta_base, w, stai_noise = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]

    # Modulate beta: High anxiety reduces beta (increases noise/randomness)
    # The denominator (1 + term) ensures beta decreases smoothly as STAI rises
    beta_eff = beta_base / (1.0 + (stai_noise * stai_score * 5.0)) 
    # Multiplied by 5.0 to give the [0,1] parameter more impact range

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        # Use effective beta modulated by anxiety
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta_eff * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[int(action_1[trial])]
        
        state_idx = int(state[trial])
        a1 = int(action_1[trial])
        a2 = int(action_2[trial])

        # --- Standard Updates ---
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] - q_stage1_mf[a1]
        q_stage1_mf[a1] += lr * delta_stage1

        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] += lr * delta_stage2

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Perseveration
This model hypothesizes that anxiety increases "stickiness" or perseveration. Anxious participants may rely on safety behaviors, repeating the previous Stage 1 choice regardless of the outcome, to avoid the cognitive load of re-evaluating the transition structure.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with Anxiety-Driven Perseveration.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety leads to motor perseveration (stickiness). 
    The model adds a 'bonus' to the Q-value of the previously chosen
    Stage 1 action, with the magnitude of the bonus scaled by STAI.
    
    Parameters:
    lr: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] Mixing weight.
    stai_persev: [0, 1] Perseveration strength scaled by anxiety.
    """

    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]

    # Calculate perseveration bonus based on anxiety
    # We scale this up slightly so the [0,1] parameter has meaningful impact on Q-values
    persev_bonus = stai_persev * stai_score * 2.0

        if last_action_1 != -1:
            q_net_biased[last_action_1] += persev_bonus
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net_biased)

        # Store action for next trial's perseveration
        last_action_1 = a1

        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---

        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2]
