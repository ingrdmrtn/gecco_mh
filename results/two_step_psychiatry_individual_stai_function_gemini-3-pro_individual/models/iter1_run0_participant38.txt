Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the STAI anxiety score into the decision-making process in different ways.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Learning Rate
This model posits that anxiety levels influence how quickly a participant updates their beliefs (learning rate). High anxiety might lead to hyper-responsiveness to outcomes (high learning rate) or, conversely, difficulty in updating beliefs.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model where Learning Rate is modulated by STAI anxiety score.
    
    Parameters:
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - lr_base: [0, 1] Baseline learning rate.
    - lr_mod: [-1, 1] Modulation of learning rate by STAI. 
              (lr = lr_base + lr_mod * stai)
    """
    beta, w, lr_base, lr_mod = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_val = stai[0]
    
    # Calculate effective learning rate based on STAI
    learning_rate = lr_base + (lr_mod * stai_val)
    learning_rate = np.clip(learning_rate, 0.0, 1.0)
    
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # State (Planet) x Action (Alien)

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Model-Based Value: Expected value of best option in next state
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Hybrid Value: Mix MB and MF
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        # Softmax Choice 1
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[int(action_1[trial])]
        
        state_idx = int(state[trial])

        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---
        # Softmax Choice 2 based on current planet's aliens
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[int(action_2[trial])]
        
        # --- Updates ---
        a1 = int(action_1[trial])
        a2 = int(action_2[trial])
        r = reward[trial]

        # Stage 1 Update (SARSA-style: drive Stage 1 MF value by Stage 2 Q-value)
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] - q_stage1_mf[a1]
        q_stage1_mf[a1] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # Stage 2 Update (Reward Prediction Error)
        delta_stage2 = r - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Modulated Inverse Temperature (Beta)
This model hypothesizes that anxiety affects the noise or consistency in decision-making. A high STAI score might act as a stressor that increases decision noise (lowering beta) or, alternatively, leads to rigid/deterministic responding (increasing beta).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model where Inverse Temperature (Beta) is modulated by STAI.
    
    Parameters:

    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature.
    - beta_mod: [-5, 5] Modulation of beta by STAI.
                (beta = beta_base + beta_mod * stai)

    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_val = stai[0]

### Model 3: Anxiety-Modulated Choice Stickiness
This model investigates whether anxiety leads to perseverative behavior (stickiness). It adds a "stickiness" bonus to the previously chosen spaceship, the magnitude of which is determined by the STAI score.

    - beta: [0, 10]
