Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the STAI anxiety score into the decision-making process in different ways.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Learning Rate
This model hypothesizes that high anxiety leads to "over-learning" from negative outcomes or volatility, effectively increasing the learning rate. Anxious individuals might update their beliefs more rapidly in response to prediction errors, making their behavior more volatile.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Learning Rate.
    
    Hypothesis: Higher anxiety (STAI) leads to higher learning rates (alpha),
    suggesting anxious individuals are more reactive to recent outcomes and
    have shorter integration windows for reward history.
    
    Parameters:
    - base_learning_rate: [0, 1] Baseline learning rate.
    - anxiety_boost: [0, 1] Additional learning rate scaling based on STAI.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight for Model-Based (1) vs Model-Free (0) control.
    """
    base_learning_rate, anxiety_boost, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    participant_stai = stai[0]

    # Effective learning rate increases with anxiety
    alpha = base_learning_rate + (anxiety_boost * participant_stai)
    alpha = np.clip(alpha, 0.0, 1.0)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        q_net = (w * q_stage1_mb) + ((1 - w) * q_stage1_mf)
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[int(action_1[trial])]
        
        state_idx = int(state[trial])

        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[int(action_2[trial])]

        # --- Updates ---
        # Update stage 1 MF value using the higher effective alpha
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, int(action_2[trial])] - q_stage1_mf[int(action_1[trial])]
        q_stage1_mf[int(action_1[trial])] += alpha * delta_stage1
        
        # Update stage 2 MF value using the higher effective alpha
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, int(action_2[trial])]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, int(action_2[trial])] += alpha * delta_stage2

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Exploration (Inverse Temperature Modulation)
This model hypothesizes that anxiety affects the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Specifically, high anxiety might lead to more stochastic (random) behavior due to difficulty concentrating or increased decision noise, modeled as a reduction in the inverse temperature parameter `beta`.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Exploration (Beta Modulation).
    
    Hypothesis: High anxiety increases decision noise (decreases beta).
    Anxious individuals might exhibit less deterministic choices regardless
    of value differences.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    - beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature (for low anxiety).
    - anxiety_noise: [0, 10] Reduction in beta proportional to STAI.
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight for Model-Based (1) vs Model-Free (0).
    """
    learning_rate, beta_base, anxiety_noise, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    participant_stai = stai[0]

    # Effective beta decreases as anxiety increases (more noise)
    beta_effective = beta_base - (anxiety_noise * participant_stai)
    beta_effective = np.maximum(beta_effective, 0.0) # Ensure beta doesn't go negative

### Model 3: Anxiety-Specific Perseveration
This model posits that anxiety leads to "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of the outcome (reward/punishment). This is often seen as a safety behavior or avoidance of decision-making effort in anxious states.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 3: Anxiety-Specific Perseveration.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety increases 'stickiness' or choice perseveration.
    An extra 'stickiness' bonus is added to the Q-value of the previously 
    chosen action, scaled by the STAI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
