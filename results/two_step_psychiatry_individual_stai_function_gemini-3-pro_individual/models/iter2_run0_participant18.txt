Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the STAI score into different mechanisms of the two-step task: exploration noise (Beta), learning speed (Learning Rate), and habit formation (Stickiness).

### Model 1: STAI-Modulated Exploration (Beta)
This model hypothesizes that anxiety levels influence the "noise" or randomness in decision-making. High anxiety might lead to more erratic choices (lower beta), or conversely, more rigid behavior (higher beta). Here, the inverse temperature `beta` is a function of the STAI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free model with STAI-modulated Inverse Temperature (Beta).
    
    This model assumes the participant's anxiety level (STAI) affects their 
    exploration-exploitation trade-off. 
    beta = beta_base + (beta_mod * stai)
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature.
    - beta_mod: [-5, 5] How much STAI increases/decreases beta.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control (0=MF, 1=MB).
    """
    learning_rate, beta_base, beta_mod, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]
  
    # Modulate Beta based on STAI
    # We clip beta to ensure it stays within a reasonable positive range [0, 20]
    beta = beta_base + (beta_mod * stai_score)
    beta = np.clip(beta, 0.0, 20.0)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

```

### Model 2: STAI-Modulated Learning Rate
This model hypothesizes that anxiety affects how quickly participants update their beliefs after receiving feedback. Anxious individuals might be "hyper-learners" (high alpha) who over-adjust to recent outcomes, or they might be less sensitive to feedback.

```python

    Parameters:

    - lr_mod: [-1, 1] Modulation of learning rate by STAI.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.

        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)

        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] += learning_rate * delta_stage2

### Model 3: STAI-Modulated Choice Perseverance (Stickiness)
This model introduces a "stickiness" parameter, which represents the tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice regardless of reward history (perseveration). The model hypothesizes that anxiety levels drive this perseveration (e.g., safety-seeking behavior).

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):

    stickiness = stick_base + (stick_mod * stai)
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control.
