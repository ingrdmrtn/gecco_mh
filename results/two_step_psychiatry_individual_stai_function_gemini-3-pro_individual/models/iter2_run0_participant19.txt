Here are 3 new cognitive models that incorporate the STAI anxiety score into the decision-making process using mechanisms distinct from simple Model-Based/Model-Free weight mixing.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model hypothesizes that anxiety drives "safety behaviors" or rigidity. High STAI scores increase the "stickiness" parameter, making the participant more likely to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of the reward outcome or model-based values.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with STAI-modulated choice perseveration (stickiness).
    
    Hypothesis: Higher anxiety (STAI) leads to repetitive 'safety' behaviors.
    The model adds a 'stickiness' bonus to the previously chosen action in Stage 1.
    The magnitude of this bonus is determined by the STAI score.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Value update rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control (fixed).
    - stick_base: [0, 5] Baseline perseveration bonus.
    - stick_stai: [0, 5] How strongly STAI increases perseveration.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w, stick_base, stick_stai = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_val = stai[0]

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    # Calculate effective stickiness based on anxiety
    # If STAI is high, the bonus for repeating the last action increases.
    stickiness_bonus = stick_base + (stick_stai * stai_val)
    
    last_action = -1 # Initialize with no previous action

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Policy for Choice 1 ---
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Combine MB and MF values
        q_net = (w * q_stage1_mb) + ((1 - w) * q_stage1_mf)
        
        # Add perseveration bonus to the net Q-values
        if last_action != -1:
            q_net[last_action] += stickiness_bonus

        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        
        last_action = action_1[trial] # Update for next trial
        state_idx = state[trial]

        # --- Policy for Choice 2 ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)

    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Modulated Inverse Temperature (Beta)
This model hypothesizes that anxiety affects the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Specifically, the inverse temperature (`beta`) is not a fixed parameter but a function of the STAI score. This captures whether anxious individuals are more rigid/deterministic (high beta) or more erratic/noisy (low beta) in their choices.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model where the softmax inverse temperature (beta) depends on STAI.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety alters decision noise. Higher STAI might lead to 
    more rigid exploitation (higher beta) to reduce uncertainty.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Value update rate.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control.
    - beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature.
    - beta_stai_slope: [0, 10] Sensitivity of beta to STAI score.

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    # Calculate effective beta based on anxiety
    # Assuming linear relationship centered on STAI=0.4 (medium anxiety)
    # If slope is positive, anxiety increases rigidity. 
    # If slope is negative, anxiety increases randomness.

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Loss Aversion
This model assumes that anxiety modulates the subjective perception of negative rewards. While the objective reward might be -1.0, a participant with high anxiety might experience this as a more severe punishment. This model scales negative rewards based on the STAI score before updating Q-values.

    than low-anxiety individuals. This model amplifies negative rewards 
    based on the STAI score.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Value update rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for Model-Based control.
