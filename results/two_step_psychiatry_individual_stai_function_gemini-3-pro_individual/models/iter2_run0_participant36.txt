Here are three new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms by which anxiety (STAI) might influence decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated MB/MF Balance
This model hypothesizes that high anxiety impairs cognitive resources required for model-based planning, leading to a greater reliance on model-free (habitual) control. The mixing weight `w` is dynamically adjusted based on the STAI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free learner where anxiety (STAI) reduces Model-Based control.
    
    Hypothesis: High anxiety consumes cognitive resources, reducing the ability to 
    plan (Model-Based) and increasing reliance on habits (Model-Free).
    
    Parameters:
    alpha: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    base_w: [0, 1] Baseline Model-Based weighting for a low-anxiety individual.
    stai_impairment: [0, 1] How strongly STAI reduces the Model-Based weight.
    """
    alpha, beta, base_w, stai_impairment = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    current_stai = stai[0]

    # Calculate effective weight w. 
    # Higher STAI reduces w, shifting control towards Model-Free (0).
    # We clip to ensure w stays within [0, 1].
    w = base_w * (1 - (stai_impairment * current_stai))
    w = np.clip(w, 0, 1)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Choice ---
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Combine MB and MF values
        q_net = (w * q_stage1_mb) + ((1 - w) * q_stage1_mf)
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        
        a1 = int(action_1[trial])
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[a1]
        
        # --- Stage 2 Choice ---
        s_idx = int(state[trial])
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[s_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        
        a2 = int(action_2[trial])
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[a2]

        # --- Learning ---
        r = reward[trial]
        
        # TD Error Stage 2
        delta_stage2 = r - q_stage2_mf[s_idx, a2]
        q_stage2_mf[s_idx, a2] += alpha * delta_stage2
        
        # TD Error Stage 1 (SARSA-style update for MF)
        # Note: In standard two-step, Stage 1 MF is often updated by the value of the state reached (Q(s2, a2))
        # rather than just the reward.
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[s_idx, a2] - q_stage1_mf[a1]
        q_stage1_mf[a1] += alpha * delta_stage1

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Loss Aversion
This model posits that anxiety primarily affects how outcomes are perceived. Anxious individuals may be more sensitive to the absence of a reward (viewing 0 as a loss) or less sensitive to gains. Here, STAI modulates the `lambda` parameter in the reward function, effectively scaling the subjective value of the reward.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Based/Model-Free learner with Anxiety-Modulated Reward Sensitivity.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxious individuals may have blunted sensitivity to reward or 
    heightened sensitivity to lack of reward. STAI scales the effective reward signal.
    
    Parameters:
    alpha: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] MB/MF mixing weight.
    stai_dampening: [0, 1] Factor by which anxiety dampens the subjective reward value.

    alpha, beta, w, stai_dampening = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    current_stai = stai[0]

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

        # Subjective reward transformation:
        # If stai_dampening is high, high anxiety reduces the impact of the reward.
        # r_effective = r_raw / (1 + dampening * stai)
        # This makes anxious people learn slower from positive feedback.
        r_effective = r_raw * (1.0 - (stai_dampening * current_stai))
        
        # Update Stage 2
        delta_stage2 = r_effective - q_stage2_mf[s_idx, a2]

    return log_loss
```

### Model 3: Anxiety-Induced Choice Randomness (Noise)
This model suggests that anxiety acts as a "noise" generator. High anxiety might disrupt the precision of value-based choices, leading to more exploration or random errors. STAI is used to decrease the inverse temperature `beta` (making choices more random) for a given baseline beta.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Model-Based/Model-Free learner where Anxiety increases decision noise.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety acts as a distractor, reducing the consistency of choices 
    with respect to internal values. High STAI lowers the effective beta (inverse temp).
    
    Parameters:
    alpha: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    base_beta: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature (for low anxiety).
    w: [0, 1] MB/MF mixing weight.
    stai_noise: [0, 1] How strongly STAI reduces beta (increases noise).
    """
    alpha, base_beta, w, stai_noise = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    current_stai = stai[0]
    
    # Calculate effective beta
    # High STAI reduces beta, flattening the softmax -> more random choices.
    # We ensure beta doesn't go below 0.
    beta = base_beta * (1.0 - (stai_noise * current_stai))
    beta = max(beta, 0.0)
