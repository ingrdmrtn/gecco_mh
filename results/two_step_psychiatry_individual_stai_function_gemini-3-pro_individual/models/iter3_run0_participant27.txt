Here are 3 new cognitive models based on the provided template and participant data.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Learning Rate (Hyper-vigilance)
**Hypothesis:** Anxiety is associated with physiological arousal and hyper-vigilance. This model hypothesizes that higher STAI scores lead to a higher learning rate (`lr`), causing the participant to update their value estimates more drastically in response to prediction errors (both positive and negative).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model where STAI modulates the Learning Rate (Hyper-vigilance).
    
    Hypothesis: Higher anxiety increases the learning rate (faster updating).
    
    Parameters:
    lr_base: [0, 1] Baseline learning rate.
    stai_lr_sens: [0, 1] Sensitivity of learning rate to STAI score.
    beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (1=Model-Based, 0=Model-Free).
    """
    lr_base, stai_lr_sens, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_val = stai[0]
    
    # Calculate effective learning rate based on anxiety
    # Higher anxiety -> Higher learning rate (capped at 1.0)
    lr = lr_base + (stai_lr_sens * stai_val)
    lr = np.clip(lr, 0.0, 1.0)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Mix MB and MF values
        q_net_stage1 = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf

        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[int(action_2[trial])]
        
        # Update Stage 1 (TD(1) / SARSA-like update using stage 2 value)
        # Note: We use the value of the chosen stage 2 state/action as the target
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, int(action_2[trial])] - q_stage1_mf[int(action_1[trial])]
        q_stage1_mf[int(action_1[trial])] += lr * delta_stage1

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Decision Noise (Choking)
**Hypothesis:** Anxiety interferes with cognitive control and working memory, resulting in noisier decision-making (less consistent choices). This model hypothesizes that higher STAI scores reduce the inverse temperature parameter (`beta`), leading to more random exploration regardless of value differences.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model where STAI modulates Decision Noise (Beta).
    
    Hypothesis: Higher anxiety reduces Beta (increases randomness/noise).
    
    Parameters:
    lr: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature.
    stai_beta_damp: [0, 5] How strongly STAI reduces beta.
    w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (1=Model-Based, 0=Model-Free).
    """
    lr, beta_base, stai_beta_damp, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_val = stai[0]
  
    # Calculate effective beta
    # Higher anxiety -> Lower beta (more noise)
    # Using division ensures beta doesn't go negative easily and scales naturally
    beta = beta_base / (1.0 + (stai_beta_damp * stai_val))

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Negative Bias (Asymmetric Learning)
**Hypothesis:** Anxious individuals demonstrate a "negative bias," learning more strongly from lack of reward (failure) than from success. This model splits the learning rate into positive (`lr_pos`) and negative (`lr_neg`) components, where STAI specifically amplifies `lr_neg`.

    lr_neg_base: [0, 1] Baseline learning rate for unrewarded trials (R=0).
    stai_neg_amp: [0, 2] Amplification of negative learning rate by STAI.
