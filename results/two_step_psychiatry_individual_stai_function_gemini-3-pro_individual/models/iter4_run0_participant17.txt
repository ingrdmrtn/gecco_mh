Here are three new cognitive models that explore different mechanisms by which anxiety (STAI) might influence decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Inverse Temperature (Exploration/Exploitation)
This model hypothesizes that high anxiety leads to "noise" or increased exploration (or paradoxically, rigid exploitation depending on the sign) in decision-making. Instead of modulating the learning rate or the mixture weight directly, STAI scales the `beta` (inverse temperature) parameter. A high STAI score might lower `beta`, making choices more random (representing uncertainty or panic), or raise it (representing rigid, risk-averse adherence to current values).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Modulated Inverse Temperature Model.

    Hypothesis: Anxiety (STAI) affects the balance between exploration and exploitation.
    Here, the effective beta (inverse temperature) is modulated by the STAI score.
    Higher anxiety might lead to lower beta (more randomness/uncertainty) or higher beta (rigidity).
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control (fixed).
    - beta_mod: [0, 5] Magnitude of STAI modulation on beta. 
      Effective beta = beta_base * (1 + beta_mod * (0.5 - stai)) 
      (Centered around medium anxiety 0.5 to allow bidirectional effects).
    """
    learning_rate, beta_base, w, beta_mod = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]
    
    # Modulate beta based on anxiety. 
    # If stai > 0.5 (high anxiety), the term (0.5 - stai) is negative, potentially reducing beta.
    # We clip to ensure beta stays non-negative.
    effective_beta = max(0.0, beta_base * (1.0 + beta_mod * (0.5 - stai_score)))

```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Dependent Eligibility Trace (Lambda)
This model tests the hypothesis that anxiety affects how deeply participants link outcomes back to initial choices. In Reinforcement Learning, an eligibility trace ($\lambda$) controls how much the Stage 1 value is updated by the final reward (Stage 2 outcome). A high anxiety participant might have a "short-sighted" learning process (low $\lambda$), focusing only on immediate states, or a "ruminative" process (high $\lambda$), over-attributing outcomes to the very first decision.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Dependent Eligibility Trace (Lambda) Model.

    Hypothesis: Anxiety influences the credit assignment process. 
    Instead of a fixed mixture of MB/MF, this model uses a pure Model-Free approach 
    but with an eligibility trace (lambda) that is determined by the STAI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - lambda_base: [0, 1] Baseline eligibility trace parameter.

    # Calculate lambda based on anxiety. 
    # High anxiety (stai > 0.5) increases lambda (ruminative credit assignment) 
    # or decreases it depending on the sign of lambda_mod found during fitting.

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model posits that anxiety manifests as "perseveration" or "stickiness"—a tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward history, potentially as a safety behavior or cognitive inflexibility. The `stickiness` parameter is directly derived from the STAI score.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """

    of the previously chosen action, scaled by STAI.
