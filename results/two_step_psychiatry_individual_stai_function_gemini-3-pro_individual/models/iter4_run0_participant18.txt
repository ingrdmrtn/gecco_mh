Here are 3 new cognitive models that introduce mechanisms not listed in the previous feedback (specifically: Learning Rate modulation, Choice Perseveration/Stickiness, and Stage-Specific Temperature modulation).

### Model 1: STAI-Modulated Learning Rate
This model posits that anxiety (STAI) affects the speed at which participants update their value estimates. High anxiety might lead to "over-updating" (volatility) or "freezing" (low learning rate), regardless of the balance between model-based and model-free control.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model where Learning Rate is modulated by STAI.
    
    This model tests the hypothesis that anxiety alters the volatility of belief updating.
    Instead of modulating the MB/MF weight, STAI modulates how fast the agent learns 
    (alpha) from prediction errors in both stages.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr_base: [0, 1] Baseline learning rate.
    - lr_mod: [-1, 1] Effect of STAI on learning rate (can increase or decrease).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (0=MF, 1=MB).
    """
    lr_base, lr_mod, beta, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]
  
    # Calculate effective learning rate based on STAI
    # We use tanh to allow negative modulation but keep it somewhat bounded, then clip.
    learning_rate = lr_base + (lr_mod * stai_score)
    learning_rate = np.clip(learning_rate, 0.0, 1.0)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Mix MB and MF values
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf
        
        exp_q1 = np.exp(beta * q_net)
        probs_1 = exp_q1 / np.sum(exp_q1)
        p_choice_1[trial] = probs_1[action_1[trial]]
        state_idx = int(state[trial])
        a1 = int(action_1[trial])

        # policy for the second choice
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        a2 = int(action_2[trial])
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[a2]
  
        # Update Stage 1 (SARSA-style update for MF)
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] - q_stage1_mf[a1]
        q_stage1_mf[a1] += learning_rate * delta_stage1
        
        # Update Stage 2 (Reward prediction error)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, a2] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: STAI-Modulated Choice Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model introduces a "stickiness" parameter ($P$) that biases the agent to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice. The strength of this perseveration is modulated by STAI. This tests the hypothesis that anxiety leads to "safety behaviors" or rigid repetition of choices to reduce decision conflict.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with STAI-modulated Choice Perseveration.
    
    This model adds a 'stickiness' bonus to the previously chosen action in Stage 1.
    The magnitude of this bonus is determined by the participant's anxiety.
    High anxiety may lead to higher perseveration (safety seeking).
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] MB/MF mixing weight.

    - p_mod: [-5, 5] Modulation of perseveration by STAI.

### Model 3: STAI-Modulated Stage 2 Temperature
This model separates the exploration/exploitation trade-off (beta) for Stage 1 (Spaceships) and Stage 2 (Aliens). It hypothesizes that anxiety specifically impacts decision noise at the second stage (where immediate reward is at stake), making choices either more random (panic/noise) or more deterministic (rigid exploitation) compared to the planning stage.

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """

    (immediate reward consumption) compared to Stage 1 (planning).
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta_1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for Stage 1 (Spaceships).
    - beta_2_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature for Stage 2 (Aliens).
