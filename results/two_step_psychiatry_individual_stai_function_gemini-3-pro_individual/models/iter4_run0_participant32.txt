Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms by which anxiety (STAI) might influence decision-making in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Exploration (Inverse Temperature)
This model hypothesizes that anxiety influences the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Specifically, it tests the idea that higher anxiety leads to more deterministic (lower entropy) choices, effectively increasing the inverse temperature (`beta`). Anxious individuals might stick rigidly to what they believe is best rather than exploring alternatives.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Modulated Exploration (Inverse Temperature).
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety reduces exploration. Higher STAI scores increase the 
    inverse temperature (beta), making choices more deterministic/rigid based on current values.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Update rate for value estimation [0, 1]
    - beta_base: Baseline inverse temperature for low anxiety [0, 10]
    - beta_anxiety_slope: How much STAI increases beta [0, 10]
    - w: Weighting between model-based and model-free control [0, 1]
    """
    learning_rate, beta_base, beta_anxiety_slope, w = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_val = stai[0]
    
    # Anxiety modulates beta: Higher anxiety -> Higher beta -> Less exploration
    beta = beta_base + (beta_anxiety_slope * stai_val)
    # Ensure beta doesn't explode or go negative (though bounds usually handle this)
    beta = np.clip(beta, 0, 20) 

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2)) # State x Action

    for trial in range(n_trials):
        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        q_net = w * q_stage1_mb + (1 - w) * q_stage1_mf

        # --- Stage 2 Policy ---
        exp_q2 = np.exp(beta * q_stage2_mf[state_idx])
        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Updates ---
        # Stage 2 update (Model-Free)
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        
        # Stage 1 update (Model-Free)
        # Note: Using the value of the state chosen in stage 2 as the target

        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Model-Based Suppression
This model posits that anxiety acts as a cognitive load or stressor that inhibits complex, cognitive map-based planning (Model-Based control). Higher STAI scores reduce the `w` parameter, shifting the participant towards simpler, habitual (Model-Free) strategies.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Driven Model-Based Suppression.
    
    Hypothesis: High anxiety consumes cognitive resources, impairing model-based planning.
    STAI score linearly reduces the weight 'w' given to the model-based system.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Update rate for value estimation [0, 1]
    - beta: Inverse temperature for softmax [0, 10]
    - w_max: Maximum model-based weight (at 0 anxiety) [0, 1]
    - w_slope: Rate at which STAI reduces w [0, 2]

    learning_rate, beta, w_max, w_slope = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)

    # Calculate effective w based on anxiety
    # w decreases as anxiety increases
    w = w_max - (w_slope * stai_val)

### Model 3: Anxiety-Induced Stickiness (Perseveration)
This model suggests that anxiety leads to "stickiness" or perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward outcome. Here, STAI modulates a `stickiness` parameter added to the Q-values of the previously chosen action.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Induced Stickiness (Perseveration).
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety increases choice perseveration (stickiness). Anxious individuals
    are more likely to repeat their previous choice regardless of value, seeking safety in repetition.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: Update rate [0, 1]
    - beta: Inverse temperature [0, 10]
    - w: Model-based weight [0, 1]
    - stick_base: Baseline choice perseveration [0, 5]
