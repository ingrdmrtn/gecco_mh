Here are three new cognitive models based on the provided template and constraints.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Eligibility Trace (Lambda)
This model hypothesizes that anxiety affects how credit is assigned to past actions. Specifically, it introduces an eligibility trace parameter ($\lambda$) modulated by STAI. In reinforcement learning, $\lambda$ controls how much the reward received at the second stage updates the value of the first stage choice directly. High anxiety might lead to "over-attribution" or "rumination," linking the final outcome too strongly to the initial choice (high $\lambda$), or conversely, a failure to link distant causes (low $\lambda$).

    Stage 1 choice. 
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate of Q-value updating.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.

    # If slope is positive, anxiety increases credit assignment (rumination).
    # If negative, anxiety decreases it (short-sightedness).

### Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Subjective Disappointment
This model hypothesizes that anxious individuals process the absence of a reward (0 coins) not as a neutral event, but as a negative outcome (a loss). While the objective reward is 0, the *subjective* utility becomes negative, proportional to their anxiety level. This biases the learning process to actively avoid options that yielded nothing, rather than just extinguishing the value.

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Model Uncertainty (Transition Distortion)
This model focuses on the Model-Based (MB) component. It hypothesizes that anxiety degrades the participant's trust in the environmental structure (the 70/30 transition probabilities). Highly anxious participants may perceive the world as more volatile or uncertain, effectively "flattening" their internal transition matrix towards 50/50. This reduces the advantage of the Model-Based system without changing the weighting parameter $w$.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):

    Hypothesis: Anxiety distorts the Model-Based transition matrix.

    participants perceive this probability as lower (closer to 0.5), 
    reflecting 'catastrophizing' or uncertainty about the spaceship's reliability.
