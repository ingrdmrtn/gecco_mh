Here are 3 new cognitive models that incorporate the STAI anxiety score into the decision-making process in novel ways, distinct from the previously tried combinations.

### Model 1: STAI-Modulated Choice Stickiness (Perseveration)
This model tests the hypothesis that anxiety increases behavioral rigidity or "stickiness." High anxiety may lead participants to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of the outcome (a form of safety behavior or perseveration), independent of the model-based or model-free value learning.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid MB/MF model with STAI-modulated Choice Stickiness (Perseveration).
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety (STAI) increases the tendency to repeat the previous 
    Stage 1 choice (perseveration), regardless of reward history.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] MB/MF mixing weight.
    - stick_base: [0, 5] Baseline tendency to repeat the last choice.
    - stick_mod: [-5, 5] Modulation of stickiness by STAI.

    learning_rate, beta, w, stick_base, stick_mod = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]
    
    # Calculate stickiness parameter based on STAI
    # High STAI -> Higher stickiness (if stick_mod is positive)
    stickiness = stick_base + (stick_mod * stai_score)
    
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    last_action_1 = -1 # Initialize as -1 (no previous choice)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

        # Combine MB and MF values

        # Add stickiness bonus to the previously chosen action

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: STAI-Modulated Valence-Dependent Learning
This model posits that anxiety introduces an asymmetry in how people learn from positive versus negative prediction errors. Specifically, high anxiety might make individuals "hyper-learners" from negative outcomes (omission of reward), causing them to adjust their values more drastically when they don't get a coin compared to when they do.

    from negative outcomes.

    - lr: [0, 1] Base learning rate (used for positive PEs).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.

### Model 3: STAI-Modulated Stage 2 Learning Rate (Hyper-vigilance)
This model separates the learning rates for Stage 1 (spaceships) and Stage 2 (aliens). It hypothesizes that anxiety specifically affects "local" learning about immediate threats/rewards (the aliens in Stage 2) due to hyper-vigilance, while the more abstract Stage 1 learning remains stable. This differs from global learning rate modulation.

    rate for Stage 2 compared to Stage 1.
