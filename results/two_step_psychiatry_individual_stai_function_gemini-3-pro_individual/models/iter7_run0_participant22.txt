Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the STAI anxiety score into the decision-making process, distinct from the parameter combinations previously explored.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Induced Working Memory Decay
This model hypothesizes that anxiety acts as a cognitive load, accelerating the decay of value representations in working memory. While the agent learns from chosen actions, the values of *unchosen* actions (counterfactuals or simply neglected options) decay back to a neutral prior more rapidly for high-anxiety individuals. This reflects the difficulty anxious individuals may have in maintaining stable representations of the entire state space over time.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: Anxiety-Induced Working Memory Decay.
    
    This model assumes that anxiety consumes cognitive resources, leading to 
    faster forgetting of action values for options that were NOT chosen. 
    High anxiety leads to a higher decay rate, causing the agent to lose 
    learned values of unvisited states/actions more quickly.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard learning rate for chosen actions.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    - w: [0, 1] Mixing weight (0=Model-Free, 1=Model-Based).
    - decay_base: [0, 1] Base rate of memory decay for unchosen options.
    - decay_stai_slope: [0, 1] How much STAI increases the decay rate.

### Model 2: Anxiety-Modulated Terminal Choice Precision
This model separates the decision noise (inverse temperature $\beta$) into two stages. It hypothesizes that anxiety specifically degrades decision-making at the "terminal" stage (Stage 2: choosing the alien) rather than the planning stage (Stage 1: choosing the ship). While Stage 1 relies on abstract planning (where high anxiety might actually increase rigidity), Stage 2 is the immediate confrontation with the reward source. High anxiety is modeled as causing "choking under pressure" or increased noise specifically at this final step.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 2: Anxiety-Modulated Terminal Choice Precision.
    
    This model posits that anxiety differentially affects the exploration/exploitation 
    balance (beta) at Stage 2 compared to Stage 1. It assumes that anxious 
    individuals may plan normally (Stage 1) but exhibit more erratic or 
    noisy behavior when facing the immediate reward source (Stage 2).

    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Value update rate.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight of Model-Based system.

    - beta_stage2_stai_slope: [-5, 5] How STAI modulates Stage 2 precision.
      (Negative slope = anxiety increases noise/randomness at Stage 2).

### Model 3: Anxiety-Modulated Structural Surprise Learning
This model suggests that anxiety affects how agents learn specifically from "Rare" (surprising) transitions versus "Common" (expected) transitions. High anxiety is often linked to hyper-vigilance regarding unexpected outcomes. This model proposes that when a Rare transition occurs (e.g., Spaceship A goes to Planet Y), anxious individuals boost their learning rate for the Model-Free Stage 1 update, effectively over-reacting to structural surprises.

```python

    when the transition structure violates expectations (a "Rare" transition).
    Anxious individuals may be hyper-sensitive to these structural surprises, 
    updating their Stage 1 values more aggressively when the spaceship goes 
    to the unlikely planet.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate_common: [0, 1] Learning rate for trials with Common transitions.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
