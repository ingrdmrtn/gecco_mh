Here are 3 new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms for how anxiety (STAI) might influence decision-making in this two-step task.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Pruning (State-Space Neglect)
This model hypothesizes that high anxiety leads to a "tunnel vision" effect or cognitive resource depletion, causing participants to neglect the transition structure of the task. Specifically, anxiety modulates the perceived transition matrix. Instead of using the true 70/30 probabilities for Model-Based planning, anxious individuals might "prune" the rare transition, treating the common transition as deterministic (100/0) or, conversely, flattening it towards uniform uncertainty (50/50) due to confusion. Here, we model it as a shift towards a deterministic (heuristic) transition belief, effectively simplifying the planning tree.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Transition Belief (Pruning).
    
    Hypothesis: Higher anxiety (STAI) causes participants to simplify the 
    model-based transition matrix. Instead of using the true stochastic 
    probabilities (0.7/0.3), anxious individuals push their internal model 
    towards determinism (1.0/0.0) to reduce cognitive load, effectively 
    ignoring the possibility of rare transitions during planning.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax choice rule.
    w: [0, 1] - Weight for model-based control (0=MF, 1=MB).
    pruning_factor: [0, 1] - Scaling factor for how much STAI increases the perceived common transition probability.

    # If pruning_factor is high and STAI is high, p_common approaches 1.0

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Exploration (Inverse Temperature Modulation)
This model tests the hypothesis that anxiety increases decision noise or "randomness" (exploration), perhaps due to an inability to settle on a strategy or high arousal interfering with value comparison. Instead of affecting learning rates or MB/MF weights directly, STAI modulates the `beta` (inverse temperature) parameter. Specifically, high anxiety might lower beta, leading to more stochastic choices.

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """

    Hypothesis: High anxiety increases decision noise (lowers signal-to-noise ratio).

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta_base: [0, 10] - Baseline inverse temperature for low anxiety.

    # We normalize STAI (assuming range ~20-80) to be roughly 0-1 relative offset
    norm_stai = (current_stai - 20) / 60.0
    if norm_stai < 0: norm_stai = 0

### Model 3: Anxiety-Induced Perseveration (Stickiness)
This model hypothesizes that anxiety leads to rigid, repetitive behavior (perseveration) as a safety mechanism or due to cognitive inflexibility. This is distinct from learning; it is a tendency to repeat the previous motor action regardless of reward outcome. STAI modulates the strength of this "stickiness" parameter.
