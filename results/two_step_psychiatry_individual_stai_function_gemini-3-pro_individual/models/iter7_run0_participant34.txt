Here are three new cognitive models exploring different mechanisms by which anxiety (STAI) might influence decision-making in the two-step task, specifically focusing on learning rates and model-based control.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Learning Rates (Valence Asymmetry)
This model tests the hypothesis that anxiety creates a bias in how people learn from positive versus negative prediction errors. High anxiety is often associated with a "negativity bias," where negative outcomes (omission of reward) are learned from more intensely than positive outcomes.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Modulated Learning Rates (Valence Asymmetry).
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety modulates learning rates asymmetrically. Anxious individuals 
    may learn more strongly from negative prediction errors (punishment/omission) 
    than positive ones, or vice versa.
    
    Parameters:
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - w: [0, 1] Weighting between Model-Based (1) and Model-Free (0).
    - lr_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate.
    - anxiety_pos_mod: [0, 1] How much STAI modulates learning from positive PE.
    - anxiety_neg_mod: [0, 1] How much STAI modulates learning from negative PE.
      (Note: Modifiers are multiplicative factors on the base rate).

    # Calculate specific learning rates based on anxiety
    # We constrain the effective LR to be between 0 and 1
    # If anxiety_mod is high, it boosts the LR for that valence.
    # We formulate this as: lr = lr_base * (1 + mod * stai)
    # But to keep it safe within bounds, let's use a weighted average approach or simple scaling clipped at 1.
    # Here: Anxiety scales the learning rate up or down. 
    # Let's assume anxiety amplifies sensitivity.

### Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Model-Based Deficit
This model hypothesizes that high anxiety consumes working memory resources, thereby reducing the ability to engage in computationally expensive "Model-Based" (planning) strategies. Instead of just a fixed `w` parameter, `w` becomes a function of the STAI score.

    # w decreases as anxiety increases.
    # We use a logistic-style or simple linear clip to ensure w >= 0.
    # Linear formulation: w = w_max - (impairment * stai)
    w = max(0.0, w_max - (anxiety_impairment * stai_score))

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Exploration Suppression (Beta Modulation)
This model posits that anxiety relates to risk aversion or a desire for certainty, manifesting as a higher inverse temperature (`beta`). Anxious individuals may exploit known high-value options more rigidly (lower exploration) rather than exploring uncertain options.

    inverse temperature (beta), causing the participant to choose the option 
    with the highest Q-value more deterministically (exploitation) and explore less.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard learning rate.
    - beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature (randomness).
