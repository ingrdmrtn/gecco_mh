Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the STAI anxiety score into the two-step decision-making process. These models explore different mechanisms than the ones previously tested, specifically focusing on how anxiety might alter the balance between model-based and model-free control, or how it might affect perseverance (stickiness).

### Model 1: Anxiety-Induced Model-Based Suppression
This model hypothesizes that high anxiety consumes cognitive resources (working memory), making it harder to maintain the complex "model-based" map of the task. Therefore, as STAI increases, the weight `w` (which balances Model-Based vs. Model-Free control) decreases, pushing the participant towards simpler Model-Free habits.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Induced Model-Based Suppression.
    
    Hypothesis: High anxiety (STAI) acts as a cognitive load, reducing the capacity 
    for model-based planning. The weight `w` is modeled as a logistic function 
    that decays as STAI increases.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate for value updates.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature for softmax.
    w_max: [0, 1] - Maximum possible model-based weight (at 0 anxiety).
    stai_burden: [0, 5] - How sharply anxiety reduces the model-based weight.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_max, stai_burden = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_val = stai[0]
  
    # Calculate w based on anxiety. Higher anxiety -> lower w (more model-free).
    # Using a simple decay function: w = w_max / (1 + burden * stai)
    w = w_max / (1.0 + (stai_burden * stai_val))
    w = np.clip(w, 0.0, 1.0)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Combine MF and MB values using the anxiety-modulated weight w
        q_net = (w * q_stage1_mb) + ((1 - w) * q_stage1_mf)

        # Note: In standard 2-step models, Stage 1 MF is updated by the Stage 2 Q-value (TD-0)
        # or the reward (TD-1). The template implies a TD structure.

    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Choice Stickiness (Perseverance)
This model hypothesizes that anxiety leads to rigid behavior or "freezing." Instead of altering learning rates or model-based planning, anxiety increases "choice stickiness"—the tendency to repeat the previous action regardless of the outcome.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Driven Choice Stickiness.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety increases behavioral rigidity. This is modeled as a 
    "stickiness" parameter in the softmax function for the first-stage choice, 
    where the stickiness intensity is a function of the STAI score.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting for model-based control.
    stick_base: [0, 5] - Baseline tendency to repeat the previous choice.

    stai_val = stai[0]
  
    # Stickiness is modulated by anxiety
    stickiness = stick_base + (stai_stick_amp * stai_val)
    
    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

    prev_choice_1 = -1 # No previous choice on trial 0

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        q_net = (w * q_stage1_mb) + ((1 - w) * q_stage1_mf)
        
        # Add stickiness bonus to the Q-value of the previously chosen action

### Model 3: Anxiety-Modulated Exploration (Beta)
This model hypothesizes that anxiety affects the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Specifically, high anxiety might lead to more random behavior (panic/confusion) OR more deterministic behavior (risk aversion). Here, we model it as anxiety modulating the inverse temperature `beta`. We test if STAI acts as a multiplier on `beta`.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Modulated Inverse Temperature (Exploration).
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety alters the randomness of choices. A higher STAI score 
    modifies the inverse temperature (beta). If stai_beta_mod is positive, anxiety 
    makes choices more deterministic (exploitative). If negative (conceptually), 
    it increases noise. 
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Learning rate.
    beta_base: [0, 10] - Baseline inverse temperature.
    w: [0, 1] - Weighting for model-based control.
