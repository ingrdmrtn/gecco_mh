Here are three new cognitive models that utilize the STAI score to explain individual variability in decision-making, focusing on mechanisms distinct from those previously attempted.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Driven Immediate Hyper-Reactivity
**Hypothesis:** Anxious individuals may be hyper-reactive to immediate, concrete outcomes (Stage 2) while maintaining standard learning for abstract, distal predictors (Stage 1). This model proposes that anxiety specifically amplifies the learning rate for the second-stage (alien) choice, reflecting a heightened sensitivity to immediate feedback, while the first-stage (spaceship) learning remains baseline.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Driven Immediate Hyper-Reactivity.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety amplifies learning from immediate, concrete outcomes (Stage 2),
    causing over-updating of alien values, while spaceship values (Stage 1) are updated normally.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr_stage1: [0, 1] Learning rate for the first stage (spaceships).
    - lr_stage2_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate for the second stage (aliens).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Model-based / Model-free weight.
    - anxiety_boost: [0, 2] How much STAI increases the Stage 2 learning rate.
    """
    lr_stage1, lr_stage2_base, beta, w, anxiety_boost = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]
    
    # Calculate anxiety-modulated learning rate for stage 2 only
    # Bounded at 1.0 to prevent instability
    lr_stage2 = min(1.0, lr_stage2_base + (stai_score * anxiety_boost))

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2

        # policy for the second choice

        probs_2 = exp_q2 / np.sum(exp_q2)
        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[int(action_2[trial])]
  
        # Update Stage 1 (Spaceships) using standard lr_stage1
        delta_stage1 = q_stage2_mf[state_idx, int(action_2[trial])] - q_stage1_mf[int(action_1[trial])]
        q_stage1_mf[int(action_1[trial])] += lr_stage1 * delta_stage1
        
        # Update Stage 2 (Aliens) using anxiety-boosted lr_stage2

        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, int(action_2[trial])] += lr_stage2 * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Rigidity (Exploration Suppression)
**Hypothesis:** Previous attempts explored anxiety as noise (lowering beta). This model tests the inverse: anxiety induces "freezing" or rigidity. High anxiety leads to risk-averse, deterministic behavior where the participant exclusively exploits the option with the highest current value, effectively suppressing exploration. This is modeled by increasing the inverse temperature ($\beta$) as a function of STAI.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Induced Rigidity.
    
    Hypothesis: High anxiety reduces exploration, leading to more deterministic 
    (rigid) choices. This is modeled by scaling the softmax beta parameter upwards
    based on the STAI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard learning rate.
    - beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature (randomness).
    - w: [0, 1] Model-based weight.
    - anxiety_rigidity: [0, 10] Scaling factor: STAI increases beta (reduces noise).

### Model 3: Subjective Loss Perception (Reward Re-scaling)
**Hypothesis:** Anxious individuals often exhibit a negativity bias. In this task, receiving 0 coins is technically a neutral outcome (omission of reward). This model posits that anxious participants perceive 0 coins not as neutral, but as a punishment (negative reward). The STAI score determines the magnitude of this subjective "loss," altering the value landscape.

    """

    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
