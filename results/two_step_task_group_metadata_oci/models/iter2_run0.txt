Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task structure, incorporating the OCI score in novel ways to explain decision-making behavior.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with OCI-modulated Model-Based Weight (`w`)
This model assumes agents use a mixture of Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) strategies. The core hypothesis is that high OCI scores might correlate with a rigidity or over-reliance on habitual (MF) control, or conversely, an obsessive tracking of transition structures (MB). Here, we model the mixing weight `w` as a function of OCI.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free learner where the mixing weight (w) is modulated by OCI.
    
    Hypothesis: The balance between goal-directed (MB) and habitual (MF) control is 
    influenced by OCI traits. A base weight is adjusted linearly by OCI.
    
    Bounds:
    learning_rate: [0, 1]
    beta: [0, 10]
    w_base: [0, 1] - Base weighting for Model-Based control (0=MF, 1=MB).
    oci_w_mod: [-1, 1] - How much OCI shifts the balance. Positive = more MB, Negative = more MF.

    current_oci = oci[0] / 100.0 if oci[0] > 1 else oci[0]

    # Calculate effective w, clamped between 0 and 1
    w = w_base + (current_oci * oci_w_mod)

    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Model-Free Learner with OCI-modulated Learning Rate Asymmetry
This model investigates if OCI affects how people learn from positive versus negative prediction errors. It posits that high OCI might lead to "hyper-learning" from negative outcomes (avoidance) or positive outcomes, creating an asymmetry in the learning rate.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):

    multiplier on the learning rate for NEGATIVE prediction errors (disappointments),
    potentially reflecting perfectionism or error-sensitivity.
    
    Bounds:
    lr_pos: [0, 1] - Learning rate for positive prediction errors.
    beta: [0, 10]

```

### Model 3: Eligibility Trace Learner (TD(lambda)) with OCI-modulated Decay
This model uses an eligibility trace parameter ($\lambda$) to bridge the gap between Stage 1 choice and Stage 2 reward. The hypothesis is that OCI affects the "credit assignment" process—how much the final outcome is attributed back to the very first choice. High OCI might correlate with higher $\lambda$ (obsessing over the chain of causality) or lower $\lambda$.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    TD(lambda) Learner where the eligibility trace decay (lambda) is modulated by OCI.
    
    Hypothesis: OCI scores influence how far back in time credit is assigned for outcomes.
    Instead of just updating Stage 1 based on Stage 2 values (TD(0)), this model updates
    Stage 1 directly from the reward using an eligibility trace.
