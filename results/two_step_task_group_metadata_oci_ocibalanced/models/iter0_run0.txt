Here are three cognitive models that explain the participant data, incorporating the OCI score to modulate learning and decision-making processes.

### Model 1: Hybrid Learner with OCI-modulated Model-Based Control
This model assumes participants use a mixture of Model-Free (MF) and Model-Based (MB) reinforcement learning. The `w` parameter controls the balance between these two systems. Crucially, the OCI score modulates this balance, hypothesizing that higher OCI scores might lead to a more rigid, habit-based (MF) strategy or an over-reliance on explicit structure (MB), depending on the specific cognitive theory being tested. Here, we model higher OCI as biasing towards Model-Free control (habitual behavior).

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """
    Hybrid RL model where the balance between Model-Based and Model-Free control 
    is modulated by the OCI score.

    leading to more Model-Free (habitual) behavior.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Rate at which Q-values are updated.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature for softmax choice.
    w_base: [0,1] Baseline weighting for Model-Based control (0=Pure MF, 1=Pure MB).

### Model 2: Perseveration Model with OCI-modulated Stickiness
This model focuses on "stickiness" or perseveration—the tendency to repeat the previous choice regardless of reward. Here, the OCI score modulates the `stickiness` parameter. The hypothesis is that individuals with higher compulsive traits (higher OCI) are more likely to repetitively choose the same spaceship (Stage 1 action), regardless of whether it was rewarded, reflecting a compulsion to repeat.

    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0,1] Value update rate.
    beta: [0,10] Inverse temperature.
    stickiness_base: [0,5] Baseline bonus added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action.

### Model 3: Separate Learning Rates for Positive/Negative Feedback
This model investigates asymmetry in learning. It proposes that participants might learn differently from rewards (gold coins) versus non-rewards (0 coins). The OCI score is used to modulate the learning rate specifically for negative outcomes (or lack of reward), hypothesizing that high OCI individuals might be hyper-sensitive (or hypo-sensitive) to "failure" or missed rewards.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, oci, model_parameters):
    """

    and negative/zero (alpha_neg) outcomes. OCI modulates alpha_neg.
    
    Hypothesis: OCI affects how strongly participants update their beliefs 
    after receiving 0 coins (disappointment/error sensitivity).
    
    Parameters:
    alpha_pos: [0,1] Learning rate for rewarded trials (reward=1).
    alpha_neg_base: [0,1] Base learning rate for unrewarded trials (reward=0).
