Here is the simulation code corresponding to the provided model fitting logic.

```python
import numpy as np

rng = np.random.default_rng()

def simulate_model(
    n_trials,
    parameters,
    drift1,
    drift2,
    drift3,
    drift4,
    oci=None):
    """
    Simulates choices and rewards using the Model-Free learner where OCI modulates 
    the inverse temperature (beta).

    Hypothesis: High OCI is associated with rigidity and reduced exploration.
    This is modeled by OCI increasing the beta parameter.

    Parameters:
        n_trials (int): Number of trials to simulate.
        parameters (list): [learning_rate, beta_base, oci_beta_scale, stickiness]
        drift1, drift2, drift3, drift4 (np.ndarray): Trial-wise reward probabilities.
        oci (float): Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised score.

    Returns:
        stage1_choice (np.ndarray): First-stage choices (0 or 1).
        state2 (np.ndarray): Second-stage states (0 or 1).
        stage2_choice (np.ndarray): Second-stage choices (0 or 1).
        reward (np.ndarray): Rewards (0 or 1).
