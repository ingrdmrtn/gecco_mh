Here are three cognitive models based on the participant data and the two-step task structure. These models incorporate the OCI (Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory) score to explain individual differences in decision-making strategies, specifically focusing on the balance between model-based/model-free control, perseveration (stickiness), and learning rigidity.

    Model 1: OCI-Modulated Hybrid Model (MB/MF Balance).
    
    This model assumes that the balance between Model-Based (MB) and Model-Free (MF) 
    strategies is modulated by the participant's OCI score. Higher OCI scores 
    influence the mixing weight 'w', typically associated with a shift towards 
    habitual (MF) control or a deficit in goal-directed (MB) control.
    
    Parameters:
    learning_rate: [0, 1] - Rate of value updating.
    beta: [0, 10] - Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
    w_base: [0, 10] - Base logit for the mixing weight (before OCI).
    w_oci_slope: [-5, 5] - How strongly OCI affects the MB/MF balance. 
                         Negative values imply high OCI -> less MB control.
