Here are three cognitive models incorporating the STAI anxiety score into different mechanisms of reinforcement learning, following the provided feedback and constraints.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Exploration (Inverse Temperature)
This model tests the "Safe Bet" hypothesis. It posits that anxiety alters the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Specifically, the inverse temperature parameter ($\beta$), which controls the randomness of choice, is a linear function of the participant's STAI score. This allows the model to determine if anxious individuals are more rigid (higher $\beta$) or more erratic (lower $\beta$) in their choices.

    Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Exploration (Inverse Temperature).
    
    This model assumes that anxiety (STAI) directly affects the inverse temperature (beta),

    It uses a hybrid Model-Based/Model-Free architecture.

    - learning_rate: Rate of updating Q-values [0, 1]

### Model 2: Anxiety-Modulated Learning Rate (Distracted Learning)
This model tests the "Distracted Learning" hypothesis. It proposes that anxiety interferes with the ability to update value estimates based on feedback. The learning rate $\alpha$ is modulated by STAI using a sigmoid function, allowing the model to capture if anxious participants learn significantly slower (or faster) than low-anxiety participants.

    Model 2: Anxiety-Modulated Learning Rate.

    hypersensitivity (higher alpha).

    - alpha_base: Baseline pre-sigmoid learning parameter [-5, 5]
    - alpha_stai_slope: Effect of STAI on learning rate [-5, 5]

### Model 3: Anxiety-Modulated Choice Stickiness
This model tests the "Stickiness" hypothesis. It suggests that anxiety drives perseveration—a tendency to repeat the previous action regardless of reward history. A "stickiness" bonus is added to the Q-value of the previously chosen action, and the magnitude of this bonus is scaled by the STAI score.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Model 3: Anxiety-Modulated Choice Stickiness.
