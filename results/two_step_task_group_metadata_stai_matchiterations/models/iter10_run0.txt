Here are 3 new cognitive models based on the provided data and constraints.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Transition Belief
This model hypothesizes that anxiety distorts the participant's internal model of the environment structure. While the objective transition probability is 0.7, high-anxiety participants may perceive the world as more volatile or unpredictable, effectively "flattening" their internal transition matrix toward 0.5 (randomness). This degrades the accuracy of the Model-Based (MB) component.

```python

    """
    Anxiety-Modulated Transition Belief Model.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety degrades the internal representation of the transition matrix.
    High anxiety participants perceive the transitions as less reliable (closer to 50/50)
    than they actually are (70/30), reducing the efficacy of Model-Based planning.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - belief_distortion: [0, 0.4] How much STAI reduces the perceived common transition probability.
      (Max 0.4 ensures probability doesn't drop below 0.3, flipping the structure).

    # Calculate subjective transition matrix based on anxiety
    # Objective common prob is 0.7. Anxiety reduces this towards 0.5.

### Model 2: Rare Transition Aversion
This model hypothesizes that anxiety is linked to "Intolerance of Uncertainty." In this task, Rare transitions (A->Y or U->X) represent surprising, high-uncertainty events. This model posits that anxious participants find these transitions inherently aversive, applying a "penalty" to the Stage 1 action that caused the surprise, regardless of the subsequent reward.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Rare Transition Aversion Model.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety increases sensitivity to "surprise" or "uncertainty."

    penalty to the chosen spaceship (Stage 1 MF value), discouraging them from 
    choosing it again, independent of the reward outcome.

    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.

### Model 3: Stage-Specific Anxiety Noise
This model separates the decision noise (temperature) for Stage 1 (navigation) and Stage 2 (harvesting). It hypothesizes that anxiety specifically disrupts the immediate reward-seeking behavior (Stage 2) due to performance anxiety or immediate outcome stress, making Stage 2 choices more erratic (lower beta), while leaving the planning stage (Stage 1) relatively intact.

    Hypothesis: Anxiety acts as a distractor specifically during the final 
    decision stage (Stage 2), where the reward is immediate. High anxiety 
    increases randomness (lowers beta) in Stage 2, while Stage 1 (planning) 
    remains governed by the base beta.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta_base: [0, 10] Base inverse temperature (used for Stage 1).
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control.
