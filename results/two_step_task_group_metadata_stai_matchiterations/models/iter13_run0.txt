Here are 3 new cognitive models based on the provided template and constraints.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Reward Damping
**Hypothesis:** High anxiety is often associated with anhedonia or a blunted response to positive outcomes. In this model, anxiety dampens the perceived magnitude of the reward. This means highly anxious participants experience a smaller "teaching signal" from gold coins, leading to slower value updating and weaker reinforcement of successful paths compared to low-anxiety participants.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Modulated Reward Damping Model.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety dampens the subjective valuation of rewards (anhedonia).
    The effective reward is scaled down by the STAI score, reducing the 
    magnitude of prediction errors for positive outcomes.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - damp_param: [0, 1] Scaling factor. Effective Reward = Reward * (1 - damp_param * STAI).
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w, damp_param = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]

    # Calculate the subjective scaling factor for rewards based on anxiety
    # If damp_param is high and anxiety is high, reward_scaler < 1.
    reward_scaler = 1.0 - (damp_param * stai_score)
    # Ensure scaler doesn't go below 0
    if reward_scaler < 0:
        reward_scaler = 0.0

### Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Transition Entropy
**Hypothesis:** Anxiety consumes cognitive resources (working memory), making it difficult to maintain a precise internal model of the environment. In this model, anxiety degrades the Model-Based system's knowledge of the transition matrix. Instead of using the true probabilities (0.7/0.3), anxious agents perceive a "fuzzier," more entropic world (closer to 0.5/0.5), reducing the effectiveness of their planning.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Induced Transition Entropy Model.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety degrades the precision of the internal transition model used
    for Model-Based planning. High anxiety blends the true transition matrix with 
    a uniform (random) matrix, representing confusion or uncertainty.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control.
    - entropy_bias: [0, 1] How much anxiety flattens the transition matrix.

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Win-Stay Lose-Shift (WSLS)
**Hypothesis:** Under stress (high anxiety), sophisticated reinforcement learning mechanisms may be overridden by simpler, reactive heuristics. This model posits that anxiety increases the reliance on a primitive "Win-Stay, Lose-Shift" strategy at Stage 1. If the previous trial was rewarded, anxious agents are compelled to repeat the choice; if unrewarded, they are compelled to switch, regardless of the actual Q-values or transition structure.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """

    Hypothesis: Anxiety promotes reactive heuristic behavior. High anxiety adds a 
    bias to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice if rewarded (Win-Stay) and switch 
    if unrewarded (Lose-Shift), overriding calculated Q-values.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
