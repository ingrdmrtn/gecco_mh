Here are three new cognitive models based on the two-step task structure and the provided STAI metadata.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Induced Transition Uncertainty
**Hypothesis:** High anxiety interferes with the ability to maintain a precise "cognitive map" of the environment. While the Model-Based (MB) system usually relies on the known transition probabilities (0.7/0.3), anxious participants may doubt this structure, effectively "flattening" their internal transition matrix toward uniformity (0.5/0.5) as anxiety increases. This reduces the effectiveness of the MB planning without disabling it entirely.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Induced Transition Uncertainty Model.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety degrades the precision of the Model-Based transition matrix.
    Higher STAI scores mix the true transition matrix (0.7/0.3) with a uniform 
    matrix (0.5/0.5), representing uncertainty about the spaceship structures.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Update rate for Q-values.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight between MB and MF control (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - uncertainty_scale: [0, 1] How strongly STAI flattens the transition matrix.

    stai_score = stai[0]

    # Define the true matrix and a uniform 'uncertain' matrix
    true_transition = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    flat_transition = np.array([[0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5]])
    
    # Calculate the subjective transition matrix based on anxiety

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Win-Stay Lose-Shift (WSLS) Override
**Hypothesis:** Under high anxiety, cognitive resources (working memory) are depleted. Instead of relying purely on value-based RL (which requires integrating history), anxious participants fall back on a primitive "Win-Stay, Lose-Shift" heuristic. This model adds a bias to the Q-values based on the *immediate previous outcome*, overriding the integrated value history specifically for high-anxiety individuals.

    bias to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice if rewarded, and switch if unrewarded,
    independent of the accumulated Q-values.

### Model 3: Subjective Loss Valuation
**Hypothesis:** Standard RL models treat a reward of 0 as a neutral event. However, anxious individuals often exhibit "negativity bias," perceiving the absence of a reward (0 coins) as an active punishment. This model modifies the reward signal itself: while 1 coin is valued at 1.0, 0 coins is valued as a negative number proportional to the STAI score, causing active avoidance of "empty" states rather than just extinction.
