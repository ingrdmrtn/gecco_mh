Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate the STAI score into the decision-making process in different ways.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Learning Rate Asymmetry
This model hypothesizes that anxiety affects how participants learn from positive versus negative outcomes. High anxiety might lead to a "negativity bias," where the learning rate for negative prediction errors (disappointments) is higher than for positive ones, or vice versa.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Modulated Learning Rate Asymmetry.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety (STAI) modulates the balance between learning from positive 
    vs. negative prediction errors. High anxiety might amplify learning from 
    negative outcomes (avoidance learning).
    
    Parameters:
    - lr_base: [0, 1] Baseline learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control (fixed mixing parameter).
    - anxiety_bias: [0, 1] How much STAI shifts learning towards negative errors.
      If anxiety_bias is high, high STAI increases lr_neg and decreases lr_pos.
    """
    lr_base, beta, w, anxiety_bias = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]

    # Calculate asymmetric learning rates based on anxiety
    # High anxiety + high bias -> stronger learning from negative PE
    # Low anxiety -> more balanced or positive bias
    modulation = anxiety_bias * stai_score
    lr_pos = lr_base * (1 - modulation)
    lr_neg = lr_base * (1 + modulation)
    
    # Clip to ensure stability
    lr_pos = np.clip(lr_pos, 0.0, 1.0)
    lr_neg = np.clip(lr_neg, 0.0, 1.0)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

        p_choice_2[trial] = probs_2[action_2[trial]]

        # --- Updates ---
        # Stage 2 Update
        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]

    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Choice Randomness (Noise)
This model posits that anxiety acts as a distractor or a source of noise in the decision process. Instead of altering the learning mechanism or the balance between strategies, anxiety simply lowers the signal-to-noise ratio in the softmax action selection (effectively lowering the inverse temperature `beta`).

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Induced Choice Randomness.
    
    Hypothesis: Higher anxiety reduces the precision of choices (inverse temperature),
    making behavior more stochastic regardless of the learned values.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard learning rate.
    - beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature (for low anxiety).
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control.
    - beta_decay: [0, 5] How strongly STAI reduces beta. 
      Effective beta = beta_base / (1 + beta_decay * STAI).
    """
    learning_rate, beta_base, w, beta_decay = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]

    # Modulate beta: Higher STAI -> Lower effective beta (more exploration/noise)
    beta_eff = beta_base / (1.0 + (beta_decay * stai_score))

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Perseveration
This model suggests that anxiety increases "stickiness" or perseveration. Anxious individuals might be more likely to repeat their previous choice regardless of the outcome, perhaps as a safety behavior or due to cognitive rigidity.

    independent of reward history.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control.
