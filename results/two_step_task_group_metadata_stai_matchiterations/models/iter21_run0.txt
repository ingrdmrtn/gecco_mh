Here are 3 new cognitive models based on the provided data and constraints.

### Model 1: Reactive Model-Free Retreat
This model hypothesizes that anxiety causes a dynamic shift in control strategy. Specifically, when an anxious participant experiences a "threat" (a loss/0 coins), they retreat from computationally expensive Model-Based planning to habitual Model-Free control on the subsequent trial.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Reactive Model-Free Retreat Model.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety modulates the arbitration between Model-Based (MB) and 
    Model-Free (MF) control dynamically. Following a loss (0 reward), anxious 
    individuals 'retreat' to MF control (habit) to save cognitive resources, 
    reducing the weight (w) of the MB system for the next trial.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w_base: [0, 1] Baseline weight for model-based control.
    - retreat_factor: [0, 1] How much 'w' decreases after a loss, scaled by STAI.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_base, retreat_factor = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))
    
    last_reward = 1 # Initialize as a 'win' so no retreat on first trial

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice

        if last_reward == 0:
            # If previous trial was a loss, reduce MB weight based on anxiety
            current_w = w_base - (retreat_factor * stai_score)

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Win-Stay Bias
This model refines the concept of perseveration. Instead of blindly repeating actions, anxious participants are hypothesized to cling specifically to "safe" actions—those that were previously rewarded.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Driven Win-Stay Bias Model.

    it resulted in a reward on the previous trial. This represents a 'safety seeking' 
    heuristic where anxious agents cling to proven safe options.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control.

### Model 3: Anxiety-Induced Decision Noise (Lapse)
This model posits that anxiety acts as a distractor, introducing random "noise" or "lapses" into the decision process. High anxiety increases the probability of making a random choice, regardless of the calculated value.

    chooses randomly with probability (epsilon). Epsilon is driven by STAI.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for the value-based portion of choice.
