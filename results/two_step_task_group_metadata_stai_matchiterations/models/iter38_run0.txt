Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate STAI anxiety scores into the decision-making process in distinct ways.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Reward Sensitivity (Anhedonia/Hypersensitivity)
This model hypothesizes that anxiety alters the subjective valuation of rewards. High anxiety might lead to blunted reward sensitivity (anhedonia-like) or hypersensitivity to outcomes. Instead of assuming a fixed reward value of 1.0, the effective reward is scaled by the STAI score.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Modulated Reward Sensitivity Model.

    Hypothesis: Anxiety alters the subjective value of rewards. High anxiety participants 
    may perceive rewards as less valuable (blunting) or more valuable (hypersensitivity),
    affecting the magnitude of prediction errors.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Model-based weight.
    - sensitivity_mod: [0, 1] Modulates reward perception based on STAI. 
      Effective Reward = Reward * (1 + sensitivity_mod * (stai - 0.5))
      If sensitivity_mod is high, high anxiety amplifies reward value, low anxiety diminishes it.

    learning_rate, beta, w, sensitivity_mod = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]

    # Calculate subjective reward scaling factor
    # Centering STAI at 0.5 allows for bidirectional effects depending on the parameter fit
    reward_scaling = 1.0 + sensitivity_mod * (stai_score - 0.5)
    # Ensure scaling doesn't go negative or become too extreme

### Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Exploration (Temperature Modulation)
This model posits that anxiety directly affects the exploration-exploitation trade-off. High anxiety might lead to more erratic behavior (high exploration/randomness) due to difficulty concentrating, or conversely, rigid behavior (low exploration). Here, the inverse temperature `beta` is a function of the STAI score.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Induced Exploration Model.

    Hypothesis: Anxiety impacts decision noise (exploration vs. exploitation).
    Instead of a fixed beta, the effective beta is modulated by the STAI score.
    High anxiety could lead to lower beta (more random/exploratory choices) or 
    higher beta (more rigid/exploitative choices).

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature for a theoretical 0-anxiety participant.
    - w: [0, 1] Model-based weight.
    - beta_anxiety_slope: [0, 10] Determines how much STAI affects beta.
      Effective Beta = beta_base + beta_anxiety_slope * stai
      (Note: If the optimizer drives slope negative, it models anxiety -> randomness).

    learning_rate, beta_base, w, beta_anxiety_slope = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]

    # Calculate effective beta based on anxiety
    # We use absolute value or bounds in the optimizer, but here we ensure it stays positive
    # A negative relationship can be modeled if the optimizer finds a low base and high slope 
    # relative to a transformed input, but here we assume additive structure.
    # To allow anxiety to reduce beta, we can interpret the parameter as a difference, 
    # but to keep bounds simple [0,10], we'll model it as an additive factor.
    # If the fit prefers low beta for high anxiety, beta_base will be low and slope small, 
    # or we rely on the optimizer finding the best fit within the positive domain.
    # A more flexible approach: Effective Beta = beta_base * (1 +/- factor * stai).
    # Let's use a multiplicative modifier centered on neutral anxiety.
    
    # Modified approach for clarity:
    # beta_base is the beta at STAI=0. 
    # beta_anxiety_slope adds to it. If we want anxiety to decrease beta, 
    # the optimizer might struggle with positive-only bounds. 
    # Let's define: Effective Beta = beta_base / (1 + beta_anxiety_slope * stai)
    # This implies anxiety increases noise (decreases beta).

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven Transition Learning (Dynamic Transition Matrix)
Standard models assume the transition matrix is fixed (70/30) and known. This model hypothesizes that anxious individuals constantly re-evaluate the transition probabilities (state structure learning) rather than trusting the instructions. High anxiety accelerates the learning rate of the transition matrix, making them over-reactive to rare transitions (interpreting them as structural changes rather than noise).

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Driven Transition Learning Model.

    Hypothesis: Anxious individuals do not rely on the fixed 70/30 transition assumption.
    Instead, they actively learn the transition matrix trial-by-trial. 
    High anxiety leads to a higher learning rate for these transitions (`lr_trans`),
    causing the participant to over-update their internal model of the world after rare transitions.

    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Reward learning rate (Q-values).
