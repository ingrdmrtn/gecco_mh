Here are 3 new cognitive models based on the provided template and constraints.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Driven Perseveration
This model hypothesizes that anxiety increases "stickiness" or perseveration. High-anxiety participants may be more likely to repeat their previous Stage 1 choice regardless of the outcome, using repetition as a safety signal to reduce cognitive load.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Driven Perseveration Model.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety increases the tendency to repeat the previous Stage 1 choice 
    (perseveration), independent of reward history. This acts as a 'safety' heuristic.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - persev_bias: [0, 5] The magnitude of the stickiness bonus, scaled by STAI.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w, persev_bias = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]
    
    # Calculate the effective stickiness bonus based on anxiety
    # High anxiety = higher bonus added to the previously chosen action
    stickiness = persev_bias * stai_score

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])

### Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Model Uncertainty
This model hypothesizes that anxiety degrades the internal model of the environment. While a standard participant assumes the transition probabilities are [0.7, 0.3], a high-anxiety participant might perceive the transitions as more random (closer to [0.5, 0.5]), effectively reducing the utility of the Model-Based system.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Induced Model Uncertainty.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety introduces entropy into the participant's internal model 
    of the transition matrix. High anxiety flattens the transition probabilities 
    towards 0.5, making the Model-Based component less effective/predictive.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control.
    - uncertainty_factor: [0, 1] How much STAI degrades the transition belief.

### Model 3: Anxiety-Blunted Reward Sensitivity
This model hypothesizes that anxiety creates a form of anhedonia or signal dampening. Instead of modulating the learning *rate* (speed of update), anxiety modulates the *effective reward magnitude*. A coin worth 1.0 might feel like 0.8 to a highly anxious person, leading to smaller Q-values overall and weaker differentiation between options.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Blunted Reward Sensitivity.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety dampens the subjective valuation of rewards (anhedonia).
    High anxiety scales down the reward signal before it enters the prediction 
    error calculation, leading to lower Q-values and potentially more random behavior 
    (as Q-values remain small relative to temperature).
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control.
