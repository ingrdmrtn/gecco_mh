Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate STAI scores into the decision-making process in distinct ways.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Induced Model-Based Suppression
This model hypothesizes that high anxiety consumes cognitive resources (working memory), thereby suppressing the ability to compute or utilize Model-Based (planning) values. Instead of a static weight `w`, the weight given to the Model-Based system is dynamically reduced as STAI increases.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Induced Model-Based Suppression.

    Hypothesis: High anxiety consumes working memory resources required for 
    model-based planning. Therefore, the weight (w) assigned to the model-based 
    controller is suppressed as STAI increases.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
    - w_max: [0, 1] The maximum possible model-based weight (at 0 anxiety).
    - suppression_rate: [0, 5] How strongly STAI reduces w_max.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_max, suppression_rate = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]

    # Calculate effective w based on anxiety
    # As STAI increases, w decreases from w_max towards 0.
    w = w_max * np.exp(-suppression_rate * stai_score)

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice

    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Transition Learning Modulation
This model posits that anxiety affects how people learn the structure of the environment (the transition matrix). High anxiety might lead to "hyper-learning" or volatility in belief updating regarding state transitions, making the agent over-reactive to rare transitions (treating them as structural changes rather than noise).

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Driven Transition Learning Modulation.

    Hypothesis: Anxiety affects the stability of the internal model of the environment.
    Instead of a fixed transition matrix, the agent learns transitions trial-by-trial.
    Higher anxiety increases the learning rate for these transitions (lr_transition),
    making the agent's world-model unstable and over-reactive to rare transitions.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate_reward: [0, 1] Learning rate for reward values (Q-values).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control.

### Model 3: Anxiety-Linked Eligibility Trace Decay (Lambda)
This model modifies the standard hybrid model by introducing eligibility traces (TD($\lambda$)). The hypothesis is that anxiety affects the "credit assignment" process. Specifically, high anxiety might reduce the decay parameter $\lambda$, making the agent more "myopic" (focusing only on immediate precursors to reward) or, conversely, increase it (smearing credit assignment). Here we model $\lambda$ as a function of STAI.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Linked Eligibility Trace (Lambda) Model.

    Hypothesis: Anxiety alters the eligibility trace parameter (lambda) in a TD(lambda) 
    framework. This controls how much credit the Stage 1 choice receives from the 
    Stage 2 reward directly, bypassing the explicit Model-Based/Model-Free split.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control.
