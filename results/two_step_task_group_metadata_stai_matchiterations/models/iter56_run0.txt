Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate STAI anxiety scores into the decision-making process in distinct ways.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Induced Model-Based Suppression
This model hypothesizes that high anxiety consumes cognitive resources (working memory), thereby suppressing the computationally expensive Model-Based (MB) system. Instead of a fixed weight `w`, the weight given to the MB system is dynamically reduced as anxiety increases.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Induced Model-Based Suppression.

    Hypothesis: High anxiety consumes working memory resources, making it harder to 
    perform model-based planning. Therefore, the weight (w) assigned to the model-based 
    controller is suppressed by the STAI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate for value updates.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation trade-off).
    - w_max: [0, 1] The maximum possible weight for model-based control (at 0 anxiety).
    - suppression_rate: [0, 5] How strongly anxiety reduces the model-based weight.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_max, suppression_rate = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]

    # Calculate the effective weight w based on anxiety
    # As anxiety (stai_score) increases, w decreases from w_max
    # We clip at 0 to ensure w doesn't become negative
    w = max(0, w_max - (suppression_rate * stai_score))

    transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    p_choice_1 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)
    q_stage1_mf = np.zeros(2)
    q_stage2_mf = np.zeros((2, 2))

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # policy for the first choice
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)
        q_stage1_mb = transition_matrix @ max_q_stage2
        
        # Hybrid value: weighted sum of MB and MF

        q_stage1_mf[action_1[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage1

        delta_stage2 = reward[trial] - q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]]
        q_stage2_mf[state_idx, action_2[trial]] += learning_rate * delta_stage2
        

    eps = 1e-10
    log_loss = -(np.sum(np.log(p_choice_1 + eps)) + np.sum(np.log(p_choice_2 + eps)))
    return log_loss
```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Transition Learning Impairment
This model posits that anxiety interferes with the ability to learn the transition structure of the environment. While the standard model assumes a fixed transition matrix (70/30), real participants often learn this matrix online. This model assumes participants update their belief about transitions, but anxiety acts as "noise" or a dampener on the learning rate for these state transitions (`lr_transition`), making anxious individuals slower to update their internal map of the world.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Driven Transition Learning Impairment.

    Hypothesis: Anxiety interferes with the learning of state transitions (the 'map' of the task).
    High anxiety dampens the learning rate for the transition matrix, causing the participant's
    model-based system to rely on outdated or less accurate structural knowledge.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate_reward: [0, 1] Learning rate for reward values (Q-values).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control.

### Model 3: Anxiety-Linked Loss Rigidity (Asymmetric Beta)
This model suggests that anxiety affects the exploration-exploitation trade-off specifically after losses. High anxiety participants may become "rigid" or hyper-exploitative (high beta) immediately following a trial with no reward (0 coins), attempting to regain control, while behaving more normally after a win.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Linked Loss Rigidity.

    Hypothesis: Anxiety modulates the inverse temperature (beta) based on the previous outcome.
    Anxious individuals may exhibit 'loss rigidity': after a loss (0 reward), their beta 
    increases (exploration decreases) proportional to their anxiety, reflecting a fear of 
    further uncertainty.

    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta_base: [0, 10] Baseline inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control.
