Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate STAI scores into the decision-making process in distinct ways.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Induced Model-Based Suppression
This model hypothesizes that high anxiety (STAI) consumes cognitive resources (working memory), thereby suppressing the ability to use Model-Based (MB) planning. Instead of a fixed weight `w`, the weight given to the model-based system is dynamically reduced as anxiety increases.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Induced Model-Based Suppression.
    
    Hypothesis: High anxiety consumes cognitive resources, reducing the capacity for 
    Model-Based (MB) planning. The weight `w` is not fixed but is a maximum potential 
    that is suppressed by the STAI score.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature (exploration/exploitation).
    - w_max: [0, 1] The maximum possible weight for Model-Based control (at 0 anxiety).
    - suppression_rate: [0, 5] How strongly STAI reduces the effective w.
    """
    learning_rate, beta, w_max, suppression_rate = model_parameters
    n_trials = len(action_1)
    stai_score = stai[0]

    # Calculate effective w based on anxiety
    # Higher anxiety -> lower w (more Model-Free behavior)
    # We clip at 0 to ensure w doesn't become negative
    w_effective = max(0, w_max - (suppression_rate * stai_score))

    p_choice_2 = np.zeros(n_trials)

    for trial in range(n_trials):

        # --- Stage 1 Policy ---
        # Model-Based Value: Expected value of best stage 2 option given transition probs
        max_q_stage2 = np.max(q_stage2_mf, axis=1)

```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Negative Bias (Asymmetric Learning)
This model posits that anxious individuals are more sensitive to negative outcomes (omission of reward) than positive ones. It implements dual learning rates: a base rate for rewards, and a modified rate for punishments (zero rewards) that scales with STAI.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Driven Negative Bias (Asymmetric Learning).
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety increases sensitivity to negative prediction errors (punishment/
    lack of reward). Anxious participants update their values more aggressively 
    after a loss (0 coins) than a win.
    
    Parameters:
    - lr_pos: [0, 1] Learning rate for positive prediction errors (rewards).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control.

### Model 3: Anxiety-Modulated Transition Learning
This model suggests that anxiety affects how participants learn the transition structure of the task (the probability of Spaceship A going to Planet X vs Y). While the standard model assumes a fixed 70/30 matrix, this model assumes participants learn this matrix online, and anxiety introduces "noise" or instability into this learning process, making their internal model of the world less accurate.

```python
import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Modulated Transition Learning.
    
    Hypothesis: Participants do not use a fixed 70/30 transition matrix but learn it 
    dynamically. Anxiety acts as a dampener on the learning of state transitions, 
    making high-anxiety individuals slower to update their internal model of the 
    spaceship-planet structure, or more resistant to changing their beliefs about structure.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate_reward: [0, 1] LR for value updates (Q-learning).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
