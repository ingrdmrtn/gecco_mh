Here are three new cognitive models that incorporate STAI scores into the decision-making process in the two-step task.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Modulated Transition Learning
This model hypothesizes that high anxiety impairs the ability to update the internal model of the environment (the transition matrix). While standard models often assume a fixed transition matrix (0.7/0.3), real participants might learn it. This model suggests that anxiety acts as noise or a dampener on learning the transition structure, making high-anxiety individuals rely more on a fixed prior or fail to update transition probabilities effectively.

def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Modulated Transition Learning Model.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety interferes with the learning of state transitions. 
    High anxiety reduces the learning rate for the transition matrix, causing 
    participants to stick to their initial beliefs (or a default prior) rather 
    than adapting to the specific statistics of the task.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate_reward: [0, 1] Learning rate for reward values (Q-values).
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for softmax.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control.
    - lr_transition_base: [0, 1] Base learning rate for state transitions.

### Model 2: Anxiety-Induced Loss Sensitivity
This model posits that anxiety fundamentally alters the valuation of outcomes. Specifically, high-anxiety individuals may perceive the lack of a reward (0 coins) not just as a neutral event, but as a "loss" or a negative signal. This asymmetry in reward processing distorts the Q-values, making them more risk-averse or pessimistic.

    negative outcome (loss) rather than a neutral one. This 'pessimism bias'

    for anxious participants.

### Model 3: Anxiety-Driven "Retreat to Habit"
This model suggests that anxiety acts as a cognitive load that forces a retreat from computationally expensive Model-Based (MB) strategies to simpler Model-Free (MF) habits, specifically after a "rare" or surprising transition. While standard models mix MB and MF with a fixed weight `w`, this model proposes that `w` is dynamic: high anxiety causes `w` to collapse towards 0 (pure habit) immediately following a rare transition, reflecting a "startle" or confusion response.

import numpy as np

    """

    Model-Free habits for the subsequent trial.
