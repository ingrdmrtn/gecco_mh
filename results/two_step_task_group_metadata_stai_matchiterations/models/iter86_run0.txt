Here are 3 new cognitive models implemented as Python functions.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Induced Transition Pruning
**Hypothesis:** Anxiety reduces cognitive resources available for complex model-based calculations. To cope, anxious participants simplify their internal model of the world by "pruning" or ignoring low-probability transitions. They perceive the common transition (0.7) as more certain than it is (e.g., 0.9 or 1.0) and the rare transition as negligible. This results in an over-sharpened Model-Based value calculation.

```python
def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Induced Transition Pruning Model.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety causes participants to simplify the Model-Based calculation
    by exaggerating the probability of common transitions and ignoring rare ones 
    (sharpening the transition matrix).
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for both stages.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control (0=MF, 1=MB).
    - pruning_factor: [0, 5] How much anxiety sharpens the transition matrix.
      (0 = accurate matrix, higher = more deterministic belief).

    stai_score = stai[0]

    # Base transition matrix (objective truth)
    base_transition = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
    
    # Apply anxiety-driven pruning (sharpening)
    # We raise probabilities to a power > 1 to exaggerate differences, then re-normalize.
    # High anxiety -> high power -> 0.7 becomes closer to 1.0

```

### Model 2: Anxiety-Driven Counterfactual Regret
**Hypothesis:** High anxiety is associated with rumination and regret ("I should have chosen the other one"). When a participant receives no reward (0 coins), they counterfactually update the *unchosen* Stage 1 option, assuming it would have been a winner. This creates a "grass is greener" bias driven by anxiety.

```python
def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """

### Model 3: Stage-Specific Anxiety Rigidity
**Hypothesis:** Anxiety affects decision noise differently depending on the proximity to the threat/reward. While Stage 1 (planning) might be flexible, Stage 2 (confronting the alien) induces a "freeze" or rigid response in anxious individuals. This model dissociates the exploration parameter (`beta`) for Stage 1 and Stage 2, with Stage 2 rigidity modulated by STAI.

```python
def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Stage-Specific Anxiety Rigidity Model.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety specifically increases rigidity (exploitation) at Stage 2 
    (proximal choice), while Stage 1 (distal choice) relies on a baseline exploration rate.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Standard Q-learning rate.
    - beta_stage1: [0, 10] Inverse temperature for the first choice (planning).
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control.
