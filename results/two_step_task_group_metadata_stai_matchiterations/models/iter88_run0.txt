Here are 3 new cognitive models based on the provided template and constraints.

### Model 1: Anxiety-Gated Rare Event Learning
**Hypothesis:** Anxious individuals may exhibit an intolerance for uncertainty or "surprise." When a rare transition occurs (e.g., choosing Spaceship A but landing on Planet Y), it represents a violation of the internal model. This model posits that anxiety causes participants to "gate" or suppress learning from these rare events in the Model-Free system to prevent them from destabilizing their value estimates. High anxiety leads to a lower learning rate specifically on trials where the transition was rare.

import numpy as np

    """
    Anxiety-Gated Rare Event Learning.
    
    Hypothesis: Anxiety causes participants to suppress Model-Free learning 
    specifically after rare transitions (surprise), treating them as outliers 
    to avoid destabilizing value estimates.
    
    Parameters:
    - learning_rate: [0, 1] Base learning rate for common transitions.
    - beta: [0, 10] Inverse temperature.
    - w: [0, 1] Weight for model-based control.

### Model 2: Asymmetric Punishment Sensitivity
**Hypothesis:** Anxiety is often characterized by a negativity bias or heightened sensitivity to negative outcomes. In this task, receiving 0 coins can be perceived as a "punishment" or loss. This model suggests that anxious participants update their Q-values more aggressively when they receive 0 coins (negative prediction error) compared to when they receive 1 coin, leading to faster avoidance learning than reward seeking.

### Model 3: Anxiety-Distorted Transition Beliefs
**Hypothesis:** The Model-Based system relies on an accurate internal map of the world (the transition matrix). This model proposes that anxiety degrades confidence in the environmental structure. Instead of trusting the 70/30 transition probabilities, anxious participants "flatten" their internal transition matrix towards 50/50 (maximum entropy/uncertainty). This degrades the quality of the Model-Based value calculation (`q_stage1_mb`) without changing the mixing weight `w` directly.

import numpy as np

def cognitive_model3(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """
    Anxiety-Distorted Transition Beliefs Model.

    chance (50/50), which degrades Model-Based planning accuracy.
