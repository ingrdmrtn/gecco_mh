def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, model_parameters):
    """Hybrid model-based/model-free learner with eligibility trace and perseveration.
    
    Description:
    - Stage 2: Model-free Q-learning on the encountered planet-alien pair.
    - Stage 1: Hybrid action values combining model-based planning (via fixed transition model)
      and model-free stage-1 values. An eligibility trace bootstraps the stage-1 value toward
      the stage-2 TD error.
    - Perseveration: Adds a bias to repeat the last chosen action at both stages.
    
    Parameters (model_parameters):
    - alpha: learning rate for Q-values (bounds: [0,1])
    - beta: inverse temperature for softmax at both stages (bounds: [0,10])
    - w: weight on model-based component at stage 1 (0=MF only, 1=MB only) (bounds: [0,1])
    - lam: eligibility trace parameter propagating stage-2 TD error to stage-1 (bounds: [0,1])
    - rho: perseveration bias magnitude (added to last-chosen action at each stage) (bounds: [0,1])
    
    Inputs:
    - action_1: array-like of length n_trials with first-stage choices (0=A, 1=U)
    - state: array-like of length n_trials with reached planet (0=X, 1=Y)
    - action_2: array-like of length n_trials with second-stage choices (0 or 1)
    - reward: array-like of length n_trials with received reward (typically 0/1)
    
    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of the observed actions under the model.
