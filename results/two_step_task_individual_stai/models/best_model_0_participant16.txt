def cognitive_model1(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """Hybrid MB/MF with anxiety-modulated eligibility, perseveration, and transition-outcome bias.

    This model combines:
      - Model-free updates at stage 2 with TD learning.
      - An eligibility trace from stage 2 to stage 1 MF values, scaled up by anxiety.
      - A model-based (MB) planner using the known transition matrix.
      - Perseveration (stickiness) at stage 1 that increases with anxiety.
      - A transition-outcome bias that promotes stay after common+reward or rare+no-reward,
        and switch after common+no-reward or rare+reward; its strength increases with anxiety.

    Parameters
    ----------
    action_1 : array-like of int (0 or 1)
        First-stage choices (0=A, 1=U).
    state : array-like of int (0 or 1)
        Reached state (0=X, 1=Y).
    action_2 : array-like of int (0 or 1)
        Second-stage choices (0 or 1 within the reached state).
    reward : array-like of float in [0,1]
        Received rewards.
    stai : array-like with a single float in [0,1]
        Anxiety score. Higher values increase eligibility trace, perseveration, and transition-outcome bias,
        and reduce reliance on model-based planning.
    model_parameters : iterable of 5 floats
        - eta in [0,1]: learning rate for MF action values (stage 2) and eligibility at stage 1.
        - b1 in [0,10]: inverse temperature at stage 1.
        - b2 in [0,10]: inverse temperature at stage 2.
        - pi_base in [0,1]: baseline perseveration strength at stage 1.
        - chi_base in [0,1]: baseline weight for transition-outcome interaction (stay/switch bias).

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Negative log-likelihood of observed choices.
