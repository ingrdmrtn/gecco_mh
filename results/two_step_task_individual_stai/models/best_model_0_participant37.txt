def cognitive_model2(action_1, state, action_2, reward, stai, model_parameters):
    """Transition-learning hybrid with anxiety-modulated transition learning and stickiness.
    
    Participants learn the first-stage transition probabilities over time. Anxiety (stai)
    increases assumed volatility: higher stai -> larger transition learning rate. A
    perseveration (stickiness) bias at stage 1 is also scaled by anxiety. Hybrid MB/MF
    control is combined with an anxiety-determined MB weight (no extra parameter).

    Parameters
    ----------
    action_1 : array-like of int (0 or 1)
        First-stage choices (0: A, 1: U).
    state : array-like of int (0 or 1)
        Second-stage state reached (0: X, 1: Y).
    action_2 : array-like of int (0 or 1)
        Second-stage action on the reached planet.
    reward : array-like of float
        Coins received each trial.
    stai : array-like of float
        Trait anxiety score in [0,1]; used to modulate transition learning and stickiness.
    model_parameters : iterable of floats
        [alpha, beta, alpha_T0, alpha_Tgain, kappa]
        - alpha in [0,1]: reward learning rate for MF Q values.
        - beta in [0,10]: inverse temperature for both stages.
        - alpha_T0 in [0,1]: baseline transition learning rate.
        - alpha_Tgain in [0,1]: how much anxiety increases transition learning rate.
        - kappa in [0,1]: baseline perseveration strength (adds bias toward last chosen ship).

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Negative log-likelihood of the observed choices.
