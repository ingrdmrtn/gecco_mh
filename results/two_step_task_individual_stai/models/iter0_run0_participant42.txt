    """Hybrid model-based/model-free Q-learning with anxiety-modulated arbitration and eligibility trace.
    
    This model combines model-based planning with model-free values at the first stage. The arbitration
    weight on model-based control is reduced as anxiety (stai) increases. Second-stage values are learned
    with a standard delta rule, and a TD(λ) eligibility trace propagates second-stage prediction errors
    back to the first-stage chosen action.

    Parameters
    ----------
    action_1 : array-like of int
        First-stage choices (0: spaceship A, 1: spaceship U) per trial.

    action_2 : array-like of int
        Second-stage choices within state (0/1; e.g., aliens W/S on X, P/H on Y).
    reward : array-like of float
        Scalar reward on each trial (e.g., 0 or 1).
    stai : array-like of float
        Anxiety score in [0,1]; higher values indicate higher anxiety.
    model_parameters : sequence of floats
        [alpha, beta1, beta2, lam, w_base]
        Bounds:
        - alpha in [0, 1]: learning rate for Q-updates at both stages.
        - beta1 in [0, 10]: inverse temperature for first-stage softmax.
        - beta2 in [0, 10]: inverse temperature for second-stage softmax.
        - lam in [0, 1]: eligibility trace strength to propagate PE to stage-1.
        - w_base in [0, 1]: baseline weight on model-based control (arbitration).
          Effective weight is w = clip(w_base * (1 - stai), 0, 1), decreasing with anxiety.

    This model blends model-based and model-free values at stage 1, with the model-based weight
    dynamically increased after rare transitions (surprise). Anxiety dampens this surprise-driven
    shift to model-based control. Learning rates at stage 2 depend on outcome valence (rewarded vs.
    unrewarded), and anxiety further reduces these learning rates, modeling disengagement under anxiety.

    This model is purely model-free. Rewards are transformed by a concave utility function u(r) = r^rho_eff.
    Higher anxiety increases concavity (lower effective marginal utility), making the agent more pessimistic.
    Action selection includes:
    - An inverse temperature scaled down by anxiety (noisier choices as anxiety increases).
    - A lapse probability that increases with anxiety, mixing uniform random choice into the softmax policy.
